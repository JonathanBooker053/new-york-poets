The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along.

There were sweet\n     times and we weren’t too drunk to\n     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved\n     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say\n     my color was good.

I hadn’t laid\n     them all low for nothing: women\n     and villages, coasts of islands\n     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t\n     they all squat when I frowned, even\n     my bad old father ? But something\n     went wrong. One minute I was lord of\n     all I surveyed, and the next I knew\n     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better\n     go back to my easy throne, and leave\n\n\nthis virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid\nheavy hands upon. That was a\nretreat! how I cried to shove off\nfrom that rich tough land, my\nkind of country! and go home.\nWhat was it that beat me? The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along.

Doesn’t it make\nyou marvel at human ambition? Is that a tear?\n\n    violet:\nNot on your life, you silly ass.\nYou can read the letter, don’t carry on. No,\nmaybe you better not. It is my favorite letter.\n\n     john:\nBecause, like all\nsentimental women past their real gift-to-the­\nworld days, you’re in love with your husband.\n  (She dives for him. He grabs and pinions her.)\n\n    john:\nYou want to toss me for who’ll beat up whom?\n\n    violet:\nOh read the damned thing!\n (She breaks away from him and goes to the sculpture. During the letter-reading\n she drapes herself on it as if it represented the absent Jack to her.)\n\n\n\n\n     I don’t know if I’m well dressed enough. Where did\n     I put that rhinestone lavallière I stole from the\n     fairy at the ballet opening? Sit down, you silly\n     slut. You’re not grappling with a stranger. One\n     bite out of you and Jack won’t know you from an\n     ancient Kabuki.\n\n          violet:\n     My hero! You’re right out of a Noh play, aren’t\n     you? Prince Jasmine Jock, himself.\n\n         john:\n     Oh boy, this is great. (Reads:)\n\n     Don’t ever expect me to forget that moment of\n     brilliance when your blue eyes lit the train station\n     like a camera shutter. Your smile was like pink\n     crinoline going through a ringer. Seventeen trains\n     seemed to arrive and to bruisingly depart before I\n     caught my breath sufﬁciently to ask you for a match.\n     And then your perfume hit me like Niagara Falls.\n\n     Asked you for a match?

A train just\nwent by covered with icy ﬁr trees. The sky is white.\nI cry at night sometimes with my prick tangled in the\nsheets—wishing it would go away and ﬁnd you and leave\nme alone in my, in this lousy southern country where\nit’s colder in the winter than it ever is in the cold\ncountries. But all I do is bitch and what I mean is\nI love you.\n\nHe has a funny style, doesn’t he ? It seems like a pose\nbut it must be that he isn’t used to writing.

I do think I\ndespise you, but not as much as you would wish, or\nI would wish. It’s impossible that I could have\nlived in precisely this airy derangement for this time\nif any irony of yours could touch me deeply. It’s not\nthat I love Jack!

It’s that green stuff with the velvet smile\n     that whines.\n\n          john:\n     Dear god, I think that iron gate I put up as a weather\n     vane is creaking.

After a pause:)\n\n     john:\nAre you going to introduce me to the gentleman?\n\n      violet:\nOh Jack! My Jackson!\nwhy did you leave me?\nSince you left I’ve had\nto sell the ﬂute and the\nbathtub. And my voice\njust froze. I’ll never again\nsing the popular songs\nyou composed while you were\non. Don’t look at my ﬁngernails.\n\n      jack:\nI’ve come a long way for your sake,\nmy back all decorated like this\nand my feet covered with mold. Do\nyou know why they had to put ﬁre\nunder my lids?\n\n\n\n\n     He is like his letters!\n\n          violet:\n     Shut up.\n\n            jack:\n     When we ﬁrst went\n     riding, how like dashing Cossacks!\n     It was easy then to dress in scarlet.\n     I sat my mount prettily and hacked\n     babies and old women with a song\n     on my breast—I even let my eyebrows\n     grow! and with the gold braid and all\n     I frightened myself. There were sweet\n     times and we weren’t too drunk to\n     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved\n     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say\n     my color was good. I had a beautiful horse.\n     Why, I thought of myself as\n     Eric’s son, Lief, going towards\n     the moon with a world behind me\n     and a lot of blood to get off my\n     chest. I wanted to bellow the green\n     and black waves ﬂat and then\n     cleave my way like an iceberg! I was\n     good and I knew it. I hadn’t laid\n     them all low for nothing: women\n     and villages, coasts of islands\n     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t\n     they all squat when I frowned, even\n     my bad old father ? But something\n     went wrong. One minute I was lord of\n     all I surveyed, and the next I knew\n     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better\n     go back to my easy throne, and leave\n\n\nthis virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid\nheavy hands upon. That was a\nretreat! how I cried to shove off\nfrom that rich tough land, my\nkind of country! and go home.\nWhat was it that beat me? The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along. And still am.\n\n     jack:\nSo I spent most of my time"}]}

Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be\nback, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,\nso I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes! I’ve decided,\n      I’m letting my ﬂock run around,\n      I’m dropping my pastoral pretensions!\n      and leaves don’t fall into a little halo\n      on my tanned and worried head.\n      Let the houses ﬁll up with dirt.\n      My master died in my heart.\n      On the molten streets of New York\n      the master put up signs of my death.\n      I love this hairy city.\n      It’s wrinkled like a detective story\n      and noisy and getting fat and smudged\n      lids hood the sharp hard black eyes.\n      America’s wandering away from me\n      in a dream of pine trees and clouds\n      of pubic dreams of the world at my feet.\n      The moon comes out: languorous\n      in spite of everything, towards all\n      its expectancy rides a slow white horse.\n      I walk watching, tripping, alleys\n      open and fall around me like footsteps\n      of a newly shod horse treading the\n      marble staircases of the palace\n      and the light screams of the nobility\n      oblige invisible bayonets. All\n      night I sit on the outspread knees\n      of addicts; their kindness\n      makes them talk like whores to\n      the sun as it moves me hysterically\n      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.\n     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!\n     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered\n     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?\n     I could have stayed forever in your arms.\n     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!\n     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes\n     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque\n     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.\n     It is raining. Shall I grow trees or ﬂowers?"}]}

Uh huh.\n\n    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­\nnate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always\nlooking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and\nthat makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,\nbrown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.\nOn the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as\nthe sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can\nspare myself little sleep.\n\n     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be\nback, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,\nso I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes! I’ve decided,\n      I’m letting my ﬂock run around,\n      I’m dropping my pastoral pretensions!\n      and leaves don’t fall into a little halo\n      on my tanned and worried head.\n      Let the houses ﬁll up with dirt.\n      My master died in my heart.\n      On the molten streets of New York\n      the master put up signs of my death.\n      I love this hairy city.\n      It’s wrinkled like a detective story\n      and noisy and getting fat and smudged\n      lids hood the sharp hard black eyes.\n      America’s wandering away from me\n      in a dream of pine trees and clouds\n      of pubic dreams of the world at my feet.\n      The moon comes out: languorous\n      in spite of everything, towards all\n      its expectancy rides a slow white horse.\n      I walk watching, tripping, alleys\n      open and fall around me like footsteps\n      of a newly shod horse treading the\n      marble staircases of the palace\n      and the light screams of the nobility\n      oblige invisible bayonets. All\n      night I sit on the outspread knees\n      of addicts; their kindness\n      makes them talk like whores to\n      the sun as it moves me hysterically\n      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.\n     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!\n     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered\n     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?\n     I could have stayed forever in your arms.\n     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!\n     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes\n     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque\n     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.\n     It is raining. Shall I grow trees or ﬂowers?"}]}

I adore the Roman copies.\n      And the stench of the camel’s spit I swallow,\n      and the stench of the whole goat. For we have advanced, France,\n      together into a new land, like the Greeks, where one feels nostalgic\n      for mere ideas, where truth lies on its deathbed like an uncle\n      and one of me has a sentimental longing for number,\n      as has another for the ball gowns of the Directoire and yet\n      another for “Destiny, Paris, destiny!”\n                                         or “Only a king may kill a king.”\n\n      How many selves are there in a war hero asleep in names? under\n      a blanket of platoon and ﬂeet, orderly. For every seaman\n      with one eye closed in fear and twitching arm at a sigh for Lord Nelson,\n      he is all dead; and now a meek subaltern writhes in his bedclothes\n\n\n\nwith the fury of a thousand, violating an insane mistress\nwho has only herself to offer his multitudes.\n                                               Rising,\nhe wraps himself in the burnoose of memories against the heat of life\nand over the sands he goes to take an algebraic position in re\na sun of fear shining not too bravely. He will ask himselves to\nvote on fear before he feels a tremor,\n                             as runners arrive from the mountains\nbearing snow, proof that the mind’s obsolescence is still capable\nof intimacy. His mistress will follow him across the desert\nlike a goat, towards a mirage which is something familiar about\none of his innumerable wrists,\n                                 and lying in an oasis one day,\nplaying catch with coconuts, they suddenly smell oil.\n\nBeneath these lives\nthe ardent lover of history hides,\n                                    tongue out\nleaving a globe of spit on a taut spear of grass\nand leaves off rattling his tail a moment\nto admire this ﬂag.\n                     I’m looking for my Shanghai Lil.\nFive years ago, enamored of ﬁre-escapes, I went to Chicago,\nan eventful trip: the fountains! the Art Institute, the Y\nfor both sexes, absent Christianity.\n                                      At 7, before Jane\nwas up, the copper lake stirred against the sides\nof a Norwegian freighter; on the deck a few dirty men,\ntired of night, watched themselves in the water\nas years before the German prisoners on the Prinz Eugen\ndappled the Paciﬁc with their sores, painted purple\nby a Naval doctor.\n                     Beards growing, and the constant anxiety\nover looks.

You never muttered his\nname by mistake in my palpitating arms at\ncertain moments when the news of the world\nwas noisily grunting through its telescope.\n\n     violet:\nNot by mistake, I didn’t. Like everyone\nconceited, you are not without cause. You\nare by popular consent the best lay within\nthese four walls, and that acclaim shall\nnever be denied you by tender me.\n\n    john:\nMy own!\n\n    violet:\nDearest of all forgotten ones!   (They kiss.)\n\n      john:\nJust think! Twice in one day. Our infatuation\n\n\n     is rearriving. What trouble it will arrange\n     to stir up in the next ten minutes between two\n     oh so troubled and disenchanted hearts!\n\n          violet:\n     Yes. Yes. The trouble I long for. The trouble\n     that keeps me, and shall continue to keep me,\n     from realizing what trouble is. Dear John.\n        (They embrace.)\n\n          john:\n     Hey.

Or religious as if I were French?\n\n    Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the\nsame names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be\nnothing left with which to venture forth.\n\n     Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?\n\n     I am the least difﬁcult of men. All I want is boundless love.\n\n     Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just\nlike a pile of leaves.\n\n     However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nos­\ntalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the\nconﬁnes of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of\ngrass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that\npeople do not totally regret life. It is more important to afﬁrm the least sincere; the\nclouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what\nthey’re missing? Uh huh.\n\n    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­\nnate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always\nlooking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and\nthat makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,\nbrown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.\nOn the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as\nthe sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can\nspare myself little sleep.\n\n     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be\nback, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,\nso I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes! I’ve decided,\n      I’m letting my ﬂock run around,\n      I’m dropping my pastoral pretensions!\n      and leaves don’t fall into a little halo\n      on my tanned and worried head.\n      Let the houses ﬁll up with dirt.\n      My master died in my heart.\n      On the molten streets of New York\n      the master put up signs of my death.\n      I love this hairy city.\n      It’s wrinkled like a detective story\n      and noisy and getting fat and smudged\n      lids hood the sharp hard black eyes.\n      America’s wandering away from me\n      in a dream of pine trees and clouds\n      of pubic dreams of the world at my feet.\n      The moon comes out: languorous\n      in spite of everything, towards all\n      its expectancy rides a slow white horse.\n      I walk watching, tripping, alleys\n      open and fall around me like footsteps\n      of a newly shod horse treading the\n      marble staircases of the palace\n      and the light screams of the nobility\n      oblige invisible bayonets. All\n      night I sit on the outspread knees\n      of addicts; their kindness\n      makes them talk like whores to\n      the sun as it moves me hysterically\n      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.\n     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!\n     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered\n     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?\n     I could have stayed forever in your arms.\n     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!\n     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes\n     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque\n     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.\n     It is raining. Shall I grow trees or ﬂowers?"}]}

The holy land\n     outside of nature nothing feeds, as rocks address no sun."}]}

For we have advanced, France,\n      together into a new land, like the Greeks, where one feels nostalgic\n      for mere ideas, where truth lies on its deathbed like an uncle\n      and one of me has a sentimental longing for number,\n      as has another for the ball gowns of the Directoire and yet\n      another for “Destiny, Paris, destiny!”\n                                         or “Only a king may kill a king.”\n\n      How many selves are there in a war hero asleep in names? under\n      a blanket of platoon and ﬂeet, orderly.

You\nused to mourn for him like a model house.\nNow the neighbors are all saying you’ve\ngone down the drain. All I can say is\nwhat a drain!

If not, I may have been\n     premature in certain plans I’ve laid for your\n     so sustaining mouth.\n\n         john:\n     You know it isn’t very warm in here.\n\n            violet:\n     I’d like to think about that remark but\n     inattention has become such a habit—\n     it’s interesting and what you say is not.\n     Isn’t that blue I see, poking its nose\n     over the picture frame falling down the\n     side of the moonlit mountain to the east\n\n\nof the capitol? A screaming as of brakes.\nI hope it’s a train, I mean a boat, coming\nin. Maybe Jack will swim down its gang­\nplank into my absent arms like he used to\nat parties.

You never muttered his\nname by mistake in my palpitating arms at\ncertain moments when the news of the world\nwas noisily grunting through its telescope.\n\n     violet:\nNot by mistake, I didn’t. Like everyone\nconceited, you are not without cause. You\nare by popular consent the best lay within\nthese four walls, and that acclaim shall\nnever be denied you by tender me.\n\n    john:\nMy own!\n\n    violet:\nDearest of all forgotten ones!

What trouble it will arrange\n     to stir up in the next ten minutes between two\n     oh so troubled and disenchanted hearts!\n\n          violet:\n     Yes. Yes. The trouble I long for. The trouble\n     that keeps me, and shall continue to keep me,\n     from realizing what trouble is. Dear John.\n        (They embrace.)\n\n          john:\n     Hey.

You do\nmake me happy.\n\n       john:\nBut it upsets me that you’re never happy\nfor long. You know, Vi, I had big plans for\nus. I thought we’d start a pet shop, a\nlittle world of our own full of fondling and\nloyalty and all the tiny things we’ve missed,\nlike ripples on a brook.\n\n       violet:\nYou haven’t talked this way since that after­\nnoon in Arlington Cemetery when the football\ngame was being broadcast over the car radio.\nCome off it, you’re no gangster of the sheets.\nWhen I was little I promised myself not to\nfall in love with anyone but the best polo\npony in the western world. Polo is a very\n\n\n\n     interesting sport, second only to duck ﬁghting\n     in polls of national taste. What kind of lip­\n     stick did I have on?\n\n         john:\n     Raspberry. Right?\n\n          violet:\n     I knew you didn’t love me.\n\n         john:\n     You never knew. You don’t know now. You’ll\n     never be able to guess I don’t and I’ll\n     never give you any security on that score.\n     What do you want from life anyway? If you\n     weren’t so elegant in all the intimate areas\n     where a man needs a lilting simplicity we\n     might have ﬂamed like a rubber tire.\n\n           violet:\n     You’re cute as a pumpkin. I wonder what Jack\n     will look like. Do you think he’ll still\n     love me? I hope so. If not, I may have been\n     premature in certain plans I’ve laid for your\n     so sustaining mouth.\n\n         john:\n     You know it isn’t very warm in here.\n\n            violet:\n     I’d like to think about that remark but\n     inattention has become such a habit—\n     it’s interesting and what you say is not.\n     Isn’t that blue I see, poking its nose\n     over the picture frame falling down the\n     side of the moonlit mountain to the east\n\n\nof the capitol? A screaming as of brakes.\nI hope it’s a train, I mean a boat, coming\nin. Maybe Jack will swim down its gang­\nplank into my absent arms like he used to\nat parties. He was the living proof that\nall women are members of the same sex.\n\n      john:\nSo is everybody else.\n\n     violet:\nWell, I guess some\nmen are just more alive than others.\n\n     john:\nI didn’t know you were so fond of this\nmale war bride. You never muttered his\nname by mistake in my palpitating arms at\ncertain moments when the news of the world\nwas noisily grunting through its telescope.\n\n     violet:\nNot by mistake, I didn’t. Like everyone\nconceited, you are not without cause. You\nare by popular consent the best lay within\nthese four walls, and that acclaim shall\nnever be denied you by tender me.\n\n    john:\nMy own!\n\n    violet:\nDearest of all forgotten ones!   (They kiss.)\n\n      john:\nJust think! Twice in one day. Our infatuation\n\n\n     is rearriving. What trouble it will arrange\n     to stir up in the next ten minutes between two\n     oh so troubled and disenchanted hearts!\n\n          violet:\n     Yes. Yes. The trouble I long for. The trouble\n     that keeps me, and shall continue to keep me,\n     from realizing what trouble is. Dear John.\n        (They embrace.)\n\n          john:\n     Hey. What’s this nasty piece of wood stuck\n     In your boobs?\n\n         violet:\n     Uh oh.\n\n          john:\n     Well?\n\n           violet:\n     It’s a letter, a letter from Jack.\n\n          john:\n     Well what are you carrying it around for?\n     Haven’t you read it yet?\n\n          violet:\n     Uh! (She slaps him.)\n\n        john:\n     How come you never showed me this?\n\n         violet:\n     You were never married to him."}]}

Or religious as if I were French?\n\n    Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the\nsame names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be\nnothing left with which to venture forth.\n\n     Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?\n\n     I am the least difﬁcult of men. All I want is boundless love.\n\n     Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just\nlike a pile of leaves.\n\n     However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nos­\ntalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the\nconﬁnes of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of\ngrass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that\npeople do not totally regret life. It is more important to afﬁrm the least sincere; the\nclouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what\nthey’re missing? Uh huh.\n\n    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­\nnate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always\nlooking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and\nthat makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,\nbrown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.\nOn the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as\nthe sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can\nspare myself little sleep.\n\n     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be\nback, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,\nso I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes!

The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater.

I’ve been\n      trying to wake you up for ﬁfteen\n      minutes. Don’t be so rude, you are\n      only the second poet I’ve ever chosen\n      to speak to personally\n                               so why\n      aren’t you more attentive?

Now, I’ve heard some\n      say you’re crazy, they being excessively\n      calm themselves to my mind, and other\n\n\n\ncrazy poets think that you’re a boring\nreactionary. Not me.\n                       Just keep on\nlike I do and pay no attention.

Wherever you were\nI knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting\nfor you to get to work.\n\n                       And now that you\nare making your own days, so to speak,\neven if no one reads you but me\nyou won’t be depressed. Not\neveryone can look up, even at me. It\nhurts their eyes.”\n                   “Oh Sun, I’m so grateful to you!”\n\n“Thanks and remember I’m watching. It’s\neasier for me to speak to you out\nhere. I don’t have to slide down\nbetween buildings to get your ear.\nI know you love Manhattan, but\nyou ought to look up more often.\n                                   And\nalways embrace things, people earth\n\n\n\n      sky stars, as I do, freely and with\n      the appropriate sense of space. That\n      is your inclination, known in the heavens\n      and you should follow it to hell, if\n      necessary, which I doubt.\n                                   Maybe we’ll\n      speak again in Africa, of which I too\n      am specially fond. Go back to sleep now\n      Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem\n      in that brain of yours as my farewell.”\n\n      “Sun, don’t go!” I was awake\n      at last. “No, go I must, they’re calling\n      me.”\n              “Who are they?”\n                                Rising he said “Some\n      day you’ll know.

Or religious as if I were French?\n\n    Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the\nsame names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be\nnothing left with which to venture forth.\n\n     Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?\n\n     I am the least difﬁcult of men. All I want is boundless love.\n\n     Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just\nlike a pile of leaves.\n\n     However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nos­\ntalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the\nconﬁnes of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of\ngrass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that\npeople do not totally regret life. It is more important to afﬁrm the least sincere; the\nclouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what\nthey’re missing? Uh huh.\n\n    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­\nnate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always\nlooking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and\nthat makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,\nbrown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.\nOn the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as\nthe sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can\nspare myself little sleep.\n\n     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be\nback, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,\nso I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes! I’ve decided,\n      I’m letting my ﬂock run around,\n      I’m dropping my pastoral pretensions!\n      and leaves don’t fall into a little halo\n      on my tanned and worried head.\n      Let the houses ﬁll up with dirt.\n      My master died in my heart.\n      On the molten streets of New York\n      the master put up signs of my death.\n      I love this hairy city.\n      It’s wrinkled like a detective story\n      and noisy and getting fat and smudged\n      lids hood the sharp hard black eyes.\n      America’s wandering away from me\n      in a dream of pine trees and clouds\n      of pubic dreams of the world at my feet.\n      The moon comes out: languorous\n      in spite of everything, towards all\n      its expectancy rides a slow white horse.\n      I walk watching, tripping, alleys\n      open and fall around me like footsteps\n      of a newly shod horse treading the\n      marble staircases of the palace\n      and the light screams of the nobility\n      oblige invisible bayonets. All\n      night I sit on the outspread knees\n      of addicts; their kindness\n      makes them talk like whores to\n      the sun as it moves me hysterically\n      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.\n     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!\n     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered\n     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?\n     I could have stayed forever in your arms.\n     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!\n     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes\n     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque\n     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.\n     It is raining. Shall I grow trees or ﬂowers?"}]}

          where I lived, I went each\n                       day after school and some nights\n                       with my various dogs, the\n                       terrier that bit people, Arno\n                       the shepherd (who used to\n                       be wild but had stopped), the\n                       wire-haired that took ﬁts\n                       and ﬁnally the boring gentle\n                       cocker, spotted brown and white,\n                        named Freckles        there,\n\n                       the wind sounded exactly like\n                       Stravinsky\n                                   I ﬁrst recognized art\n                       as wildness, and it seemed right,\n                                   I mean rite, to me\n\n                       climbing the water tower I’d\n                       look out for hours in wind\n                       and the world seemed rounder\n                       and ﬁercer and I was happier\n                       because I wasn’t scared of falling off\n\n                       nor off the horses, the horses!\n                       to hell with the horses, bay and black\n\n            It’s odd to have secrets at an early age, trysts\n      whose thoughtfulness and sweetness are those of a very aggressive person\n                 carried beneath your shirt like an amulet against your sire\n                    what one must do is done in a red twilight\n                           on colossally old and dirty furniture with knobs,\n                    and on Sunday afternoons you meet in a high place\n                    watching the Sunday drivers and the symphonic sadness\n                 stopped, a man in a convertible put his hand up a girl’s skirt\n             and again the twitching odor of hay, like a minor irritation\n      that gives you a hardon, and again the roundness of horse noises\n\n\n           “Je suis las de vivre au pays natal”\n                  but unhappiness, like Mercury, transﬁxed me\n           there, un repaire de vipères\n                  and had I known the strength and durability\nof those invisible bonds I would have leaped from rafters onto prongs\nthen\n          and been carried shining and intact\n          to the Indian Cemetery near the lake\n                                                          but there is a glistening\n                                                          blackness in the center\n                                                          if you seek it\nhere . . .     it’s capable of bursting\n               into ﬂame or merely\n               gleaming profoundly in\n                                                          the platinum setting\n                                                          of your ornamental\n                                                          human ties and hates\nhanging between breasts\n                              or, crosslike, on a chest of hairs\nthe center of myself is never silent\n                                             the wind soars, keening overhead\nand the vestments of unnatural safety\n                                             part to reveal a foreign land\ntoward whom I have been selected to bear\n                                                  the gift of ﬁre\n                      the temporary place of light, the land of air\n\ndown where a ﬂame illumines gravity and means warmth and insight,\n     where air is ﬂesh, where speed is darkness\nand\n     things can suddenly be reached, held, dropped and known\n\nwhere a not totally imaginary ascent can begin all over again in tears\n\n\n         A couple of speciﬁcally anguished days\n         make me now distrust sorrow, simple sorrow\n         especially, like sorrow over death\n              it makes you wonder who you are to be sorrowful\n              over death, death belonging to another\n              and suddenly inhabited by you without permission\n\n              you moved in impulsively and took it up\n              declaring your Squatters’ Rights in howls\n              or screaming with rage, like a parvenu in a Chinese laundry\n\n              disbelieving your own feelings is the worst\n              and you suspect that you are jealous of this death\n\n                YIPPEE! I’m glad I’m alive\n                                                “I’m glad you’re alive\n            too, baby, because I want to fuck you”\n                                                     you are pink\n            and despicable in the warm breeze drifting in the window\n      and the rent\n                     is due, in honor of which you have borrowed $34.96 from Joe\n      and it’s all over but the smoldering hatred of pleasure\n            a gorgeous purple like somebody’s favorite tie\n                “Shit, that means you’re getting kind of ascetic, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n                       So I left, the stars were shining\n                       like the lights around a swimming pool\n\n                        you’ve seen a lot of anemones, too\n                        haven’t you, Old Paint? through the\n                        Painted Desert to the orange covered\n                        slopes where a big hill was moving in\n                        on L A and other stars were strolling\n                        in shorts down palm-stacked horse-walks\n                        and I stared with my strained SP stare\n                        wearing a gun\n                                        the doubts\n              of a life devoted to leaving rumors of love for new\n      from does she love me to do I love him,"}]}

I adore the Roman copies.\n      And the stench of the camel’s spit I swallow,\n      and the stench of the whole goat. For we have advanced, France,\n      together into a new land, like the Greeks, where one feels nostalgic\n      for mere ideas, where truth lies on its deathbed like an uncle\n      and one of me has a sentimental longing for number,\n      as has another for the ball gowns of the Directoire and yet\n      another for “Destiny, Paris, destiny!”\n                                         or “Only a king may kill a king.”\n\n      How many selves are there in a war hero asleep in names? under\n      a blanket of platoon and ﬂeet, orderly.

He grabs and pinions her.)\n\n    john:\nYou want to toss me for who’ll beat up whom?\n\n    violet:\nOh read the damned thing!\n (She breaks away from him and goes to the sculpture. During the letter-reading\n she drapes herself on it as if it represented the absent Jack to her.)\n\n\n\n\n     I don’t know if I’m well dressed enough. Where did\n     I put that rhinestone lavallière I stole from the\n     fairy at the ballet opening? Sit down, you silly\n     slut. You’re not grappling with a stranger. One\n     bite out of you and Jack won’t know you from an\n     ancient Kabuki.\n\n          violet:\n     My hero! You’re right out of a Noh play, aren’t\n     you? Prince Jasmine Jock, himself.\n\n         john:\n     Oh boy, this is great. (Reads:)\n\n     Don’t ever expect me to forget that moment of\n     brilliance when your blue eyes lit the train station\n     like a camera shutter. Your smile was like pink\n     crinoline going through a ringer. Seventeen trains\n     seemed to arrive and to bruisingly depart before I\n     caught my breath sufﬁciently to ask you for a match.\n     And then your perfume hit me like Niagara Falls.\n\n     Asked you for a match? What\n     a relationship! Did he darn your aprons, too?\n     Get this. (Reads:)\n\n     The pressure of being away from you is sometimes more\n     than even the scenery can bear, and it is alarmingly\n     brazen in piling snow over leaves and dark trunks lying\n     across roads where the push of centuries is like a\n     cymbal crashing in the roots of your hair. But I keep\n     on dreaming of you whether awake or asleep as they say\n     in songs, an azure dream. When I wake up, and I wake\n     up every time I think of you, my prick presses against\n\n\n\nmy belly like a log of foreboding, and I’m afraid that\nI’ll die before I feel that thing that you are that\nnobody else is to my body, like a trembling insight\ninto myself and the world I can’t have. A train just\nwent by covered with icy ﬁr trees. The sky is white.\nI cry at night sometimes with my prick tangled in the\nsheets—wishing it would go away and ﬁnd you and leave\nme alone in my, in this lousy southern country where\nit’s colder in the winter than it ever is in the cold\ncountries. But all I do is bitch and what I mean is\nI love you.\n\nHe has a funny style, doesn’t he ? It seems like a pose\nbut it must be that he isn’t used to writing. He\nwasn’t a journalist or anything, was he? They’re\nsometimes very awkward. I see now; you were hiding\nit from embarrassment!\n\n      violet:\nI know it’s enough for you that you amuse yourself,\nso I won’t complain of my own feelings. I do think I\ndespise you, but not as much as you would wish, or\nI would wish. It’s impossible that I could have\nlived in precisely this airy derangement for this time\nif any irony of yours could touch me deeply. It’s not\nthat I love Jack! I hate my life.\n\n     john:\nPrincess Lonelyhearts.\n\n     violet:\nWell let’s not stop camping. We haven’t seen the last\nof each other, not us, not Little-Dimity-Head-Felt and\nBouncing-Broad-Britches. There’s a tear left in this\nmagniﬁcent vista yet. Just don’t rust the pipes,\n\n\n\n     darling, and don’t bump yourself tripping over the\n     arbutus. It’s that green stuff with the velvet smile\n     that whines.\n\n          john:\n     Dear god, I think that iron gate I put up as a weather\n     vane is creaking. An angel must be arriving.\n     Who do you suppose it could be?\n\n          violet:\n     Well, one thing we have in common: we’re both\n       (primping)\n     beautiful people.\n\n           john:\n     Yes, like a couple of cesspools.\n\n          violet:\n     One season you’re tan, you’re happy, you’re lying\n     beside an ocean, the hedges are shrinking with an\n     opium speciﬁc,\n\n          john:\n     the next you’re losing weight, you’re cold, you’re\n     getting bald, the ﬂoors are sealed against the\n     grovelling handclasp you extend into the bedrooms,\n     underneath the mezzanine.\n\n           violet:\n     And when lust tries to make itself tangible but ends\n     up as the plot of your favorite silent movie over rye\n     and water under a slippery overhead mist, you want\n     that stranger you always awaited to hurry up, the\n     one you told everybody was an old friend who’d be\n     along in a minute.\n\n\n\nA merchandise man from Chicago?\n\n     violet:\nNo,\nmaybe an opera star who’s retired for love.\n\n    (They retire offstage amorously. jack enters and stands silently looking\n    around. violet and john re-enter with a certain post-coitus detachment from\n    each other. After a pause:)\n\n     john:\nAre you going to introduce me to the gentleman?\n\n      violet:\nOh Jack! My Jackson!\nwhy did you leave me?\nSince you left I’ve had\nto sell the ﬂute and the\nbathtub. And my voice\njust froze. I’ll never again\nsing the popular songs\nyou composed while you were\non. Don’t look at my ﬁngernails.\n\n      jack:\nI’ve come a long way for your sake,\nmy back all decorated like this\nand my feet covered with mold. Do\nyou know why they had to put ﬁre\nunder my lids?\n\n\n\n\n     He is like his letters!\n\n          violet:\n     Shut up.\n\n            jack:\n     When we ﬁrst went\n     riding, how like dashing Cossacks!\n     It was easy then to dress in scarlet.\n     I sat my mount prettily and hacked\n     babies and old women with a song\n     on my breast—I even let my eyebrows\n     grow! and with the gold braid and all\n     I frightened myself. There were sweet\n     times and we weren’t too drunk to\n     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved\n     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say\n     my color was good. I had a beautiful horse.\n     Why, I thought of myself as\n     Eric’s son, Lief, going towards\n     the moon with a world behind me\n     and a lot of blood to get off my\n     chest. I wanted to bellow the green\n     and black waves ﬂat and then\n     cleave my way like an iceberg! I was\n     good and I knew it. I hadn’t laid\n     them all low for nothing: women\n     and villages, coasts of islands\n     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t\n     they all squat when I frowned, even\n     my bad old father ? But something\n     went wrong. One minute I was lord of\n     all I surveyed, and the next I knew\n     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better\n     go back to my easy throne, and leave\n\n\nthis virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid\nheavy hands upon. That was a\nretreat! how I cried to shove off\nfrom that rich tough land, my\nkind of country! and go home.\nWhat was it that beat me? The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along. And still am.\n\n     jack:\nSo I spent most of my time"}]}

Incorporate elements of humor and irony, and draw on metaphors that reflect the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of beauty and desire."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: John:\nContent:\nWhen I think of the two of us, frail in our\naffections, stranded on this planet of incessant\ncommunication like gophers in their sweet-nosed\nparalysis, or more similar to lovers who are very,\nvery sunburned! I marvel that we ever found it\npossible or desirable to raise our lazy heads\nfrom opposite ends of a gray fountain’s inter­\nsection with the regimented air in order to just\nsay “Are you having fun?” to the dear person for\nwhom we are preparing, with passionately efﬁcient\ndistraction, the deepest hurt, the one we did the\nsweetly sweaty and individual push-ups and cold\ncreamings for, through the years. Doesn’t it make\nyou marvel at human ambition? Is that a tear?\n\n    violet:\nNot on your life, you silly ass.\nYou can read the letter, don’t carry on. No,\nmaybe you better not. It is my favorite letter.\n\n     john:\nBecause, like all\nsentimental women past their real gift-to-the­\nworld days, you’re in love with your husband.\n  (She dives for him. He grabs and pinions her.)\n\n    john:\nYou want to toss me for who’ll beat up whom?\n\n    violet:\nOh read the damned thing!\n (She breaks away from him and goes to the sculpture. During the letter-reading\n she drapes herself on it as if it represented the absent Jack to her.)\n\n\n\n\n     I don’t know if I’m well dressed enough. Where did\n     I put that rhinestone lavallière I stole from the\n     fairy at the ballet opening? Sit down, you silly\n     slut. You’re not grappling with a stranger. One\n     bite out of you and Jack won’t know you from an\n     ancient Kabuki.\n\n          violet:\n     My hero! You’re right out of a Noh play, aren’t\n     you? Prince Jasmine Jock, himself.\n\n         john:\n     Oh boy, this is great. (Reads:)\n\n     Don’t ever expect me to forget that moment of\n     brilliance when your blue eyes lit the train station\n     like a camera shutter. Your smile was like pink\n     crinoline going through a ringer. Seventeen trains\n     seemed to arrive and to bruisingly depart before I\n     caught my breath sufﬁciently to ask you for a match.\n     And then your perfume hit me like Niagara Falls.\n\n     Asked you for a match? What\n     a relationship! Did he darn your aprons, too?\n     Get this. (Reads:)\n\n     The pressure of being away from you is sometimes more\n     than even the scenery can bear, and it is alarmingly\n     brazen in piling snow over leaves and dark trunks lying\n     across roads where the push of centuries is like a\n     cymbal crashing in the roots of your hair. But I keep\n     on dreaming of you whether awake or asleep as they say\n     in songs, an azure dream. When I wake up, and I wake\n     up every time I think of you, my prick presses against\n\n\n\nmy belly like a log of foreboding, and I’m afraid that\nI’ll die before I feel that thing that you are that\nnobody else is to my body, like a trembling insight\ninto myself and the world I can’t have. A train just\nwent by covered with icy ﬁr trees. The sky is white.\nI cry at night sometimes with my prick tangled in the\nsheets—wishing it would go away and ﬁnd you and leave\nme alone in my, in this lousy southern country where\nit’s colder in the winter than it ever is in the cold\ncountries. But all I do is bitch and what I mean is\nI love you.\n\nHe has a funny style, doesn’t he ? It seems like a pose\nbut it must be that he isn’t used to writing. He\nwasn’t a journalist or anything, was he? They’re\nsometimes very awkward. I see now; you were hiding\nit from embarrassment!\n\n      violet:\nI know it’s enough for you that you amuse yourself,\nso I won’t complain of my own feelings. I do think I\ndespise you, but not as much as you would wish, or\nI would wish. It’s impossible that I could have\nlived in precisely this airy derangement for this time\nif any irony of yours could touch me deeply. It’s not\nthat I love Jack! I hate my life.\n\n     john:\nPrincess Lonelyhearts.\n\n     violet:\nWell let’s not stop camping. We haven’t seen the last\nof each other, not us, not Little-Dimity-Head-Felt and\nBouncing-Broad-Britches. There’s a tear left in this\nmagniﬁcent vista yet. Just don’t rust the pipes,\n\n\n\n     darling, and don’t bump yourself tripping over the\n     arbutus. It’s that green stuff with the velvet smile\n     that whines.\n\n          john:\n     Dear god, I think that iron gate I put up as a weather\n     vane is creaking. An angel must be arriving.\n     Who do you suppose it could be?\n\n          violet:\n     Well, one thing we have in common: we’re both\n       (primping)\n     beautiful people.\n\n           john:\n     Yes, like a couple of cesspools.\n\n          violet:\n     One season you’re tan, you’re happy, you’re lying\n     beside an ocean, the hedges are shrinking with an\n     opium speciﬁc,\n\n          john:\n     the next you’re losing weight, you’re cold, you’re\n     getting bald, the ﬂoors are sealed against the\n     grovelling handclasp you extend into the bedrooms,\n     underneath the mezzanine.\n\n           violet:\n     And when lust tries to make itself tangible but ends\n     up as the plot of your favorite silent movie over rye\n     and water under a slippery overhead mist, you want\n     that stranger you always awaited to hurry up, the\n     one you told everybody was an old friend who’d be\n     along in a minute.\n\n\n\nA merchandise man from Chicago?\n\n     violet:\nNo,\nmaybe an opera star who’s retired for love.\n\n    (They retire offstage amorously. jack enters and stands silently looking\n    around. violet and john re-enter with a certain post-coitus detachment from\n    each other. After a pause:)\n\n     john:\nAre you going to introduce me to the gentleman?\n\n      violet:\nOh Jack! My Jackson!\nwhy did you leave me?\nSince you left I’ve had\nto sell the ﬂute and the\nbathtub. And my voice\njust froze. I’ll never again\nsing the popular songs\nyou composed while you were\non. Don’t look at my ﬁngernails.\n\n      jack:\nI’ve come a long way for your sake,\nmy back all decorated like this\nand my feet covered with mold. Do\nyou know why they had to put ﬁre\nunder my lids?\n\n\n\n\n     He is like his letters!\n\n          violet:\n     Shut up.\n\n            jack:\n     When we ﬁrst went\n     riding, how like dashing Cossacks!\n     It was easy then to dress in scarlet.\n     I sat my mount prettily and hacked\n     babies and old women with a song\n     on my breast—I even let my eyebrows\n     grow! and with the gold braid and all\n     I frightened myself. There were sweet\n     times and we weren’t too drunk to\n     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved\n     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say\n     my color was good. I had a beautiful horse.\n     Why, I thought of myself as\n     Eric’s son, Lief, going towards\n     the moon with a world behind me\n     and a lot of blood to get off my\n     chest. I wanted to bellow the green\n     and black waves ﬂat and then\n     cleave my way like an iceberg! I was\n     good and I knew it. I hadn’t laid\n     them all low for nothing: women\n     and villages, coasts of islands\n     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t\n     they all squat when I frowned, even\n     my bad old father ? But something\n     went wrong. One minute I was lord of\n     all I surveyed, and the next I knew\n     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better\n     go back to my easy throne, and leave\n\n\nthis virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid\nheavy hands upon. That was a\nretreat! how I cried to shove off\nfrom that rich tough land, my\nkind of country! and go home.\nWhat was it that beat me? The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along. And still am.\n\n     jack:\nSo I spent most of my time"}]}

sleep\neven country noises—a dog bays at the moon, but when it loves the\n           moon it bows, and the hitherto frowning moon fawns and slips\n\nOnly you in New York are not boring tonight\nit is most modern to afﬁrm some one\n(we don’t really love ideas, do we?)\nand Joan was surprising you with a party for which I was the decoy\nbut you were surprising us by getting married and going away\nso I am here reading poetry anyway\nand no one will be bored tonight by me because you’re here\n\nYesterday I felt very tired from being at the five spot\nand today I felt very tired from going to bed early and reading ulysses\nbut tonight I feel energetic because I’m sort of the bugle,\nlike waking people up, of your peculiar desire to get married\n\nIt’s so\noriginal, hydrogenic,

must be vanguard!\n\nTonight you probably walked over here from Bethune Street\ndown Greenwich Avenue with its sneaky little bars and the Women’s Detention House,\nacross 8th Street, by the acres of books and pillows and shoes and\n          illuminating lampshades,\npast Cooper Union where we heard the piece by Mortie Feldman with “The\n          Stars and Stripes Forever” in it\nand the

thought, hurrying, to Alger Hiss?\n\nIt’s the day before February 17th\nit is not snowing yet but it is dark and may snow yet\ndreary February of the exhaustion from parties and the exceptional de­\n

ripple subsiding under a\n            lily pad, or with brown, like a freshly plowed ﬁeld we vow\n            we’ll drive out and look at when a certain Sunday comes in May—\nand these eyes are undoubtedly Jane’s and Joe’s because they are ad­\n            vancing into spring before us and tomorrow is Sunday\n\nThis poem goes on too long because our friendship has been long, long\n         for this life and these times, long as art is long and un­\n         interruptable,\nand I would make it as long as I hope our friendship lasts if I could\n         make poems that long\n\nI hope

Vogues of 1938 instead, more discussions\n           in lobbies of the respective greatnesses of Diana Adams and\n           Allegra Kent,\nmore sunburns and more half-mile swims in which Joe beats me

I am thinking my own thoughts, who else’s?\n\n         When I die, don’t come, I wouldn’t want a leaf\n         to turn away from the sun—it loves it there.\n         There’s nothing so spiritual about being happy\n         but you can’t miss a day of it, because it doesn’t last.\n\n   So this is the devil’s dance?
