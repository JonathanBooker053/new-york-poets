Guernica hollered look out!\nbut we were all busy hoping our eyes were talking\nto Paul Klee. My mother and father asked me and\nI told them from my tight blue pants we should\nlove only the stones, the sea, and heroic ﬁgures.\nWasted child! I’ll club you on the shins! I\nwasn’t surprised when the older people entered\nmy cheap hotel room and broke my guitar and my can\nof blue paint.\n                At that time all of us began to think\nwith our bare hands and even with blood all over\nthem, we knew vertical from horizontal, we never\nsmeared anything except to ﬁnd out how it lived.\nFathers of Dada! You carried shining erector sets\nin your rough bony pockets, you were generous\nand they were lovely as chewing gum or ﬂowers!\nThank you!\n               And those of us who thought poetry\nwas crap were throttled by Auden or Rimbaud\nwhen, sent by some compulsive Juno, we tried\nto play with collages or sprechstimme in their bed.\nPoetry didn’t tell me not to play with toys\n\n\n\n    but alone I could never have ﬁgured out that dolls\n    meant death.\n                   Our responsibilities did not begin\n    in dreams, though they began in bed. Love is ﬁrst of all\n    a lesson in utility. I hear the sewage singing\n    underneath my bright white toilet seat and know\n    that somewhere sometime it will reach the sea:\n    gulls and swordﬁshes will ﬁnd it richer than a river.\n    And airplanes are perfect mobiles, independent\n    of the breeze; crashing in ﬂames they show us how\n    to be prodigal. O Boris Pasternak, it may be silly\n    to call to you, so tall in the Urals, but your voice\n    cleans our world, clearer to us than the hospital:\n    you sound above the factory’s ambitious gargle.\n    Poetry is as useful as a machine!\n                                         Look at my room.\n    Guitar strings hold up pictures. I don’t need\n    a piano to sing, and naming things is only the intention\n    to make things. A locomotive is more melodious\n    than a cello. I dress in oil cloth and read music\n    by Guillaume Apollinaire’s clay candelabra. Now\n    my father is dead and has found out you must look things\n    in the belly, not in the eye. If only he had listened\n    to the men who made us, hollering like stuck pigs!"

It’s not enough\nto be thoughtful, is it?\n\n    violet:\nAren’t you acting terribly prewar?\n\n      john:\nMy dear, I want you to work hard at\nreinstating that wifely melancholy that\nmade you such a distinctive asset to\nanyone “marching off ” as they say. You\nused to mourn for him like a model house.\nNow the neighbors are all saying you’ve\ngone down the drain. All I can say is\nwhat a drain! I prefer to think you were\nalways a little too nice. “If anyone\ncries in the world. . . .\n\n        violet:\n. . . it has to be me.” Please stop trying\nto cheer me up. Jesus. You’re as relaxing\nas a pin. I was a sweet, eager, pretty, and\nenergetic girl. As he remembers me, so\nshall he ﬁnd me. What ever made me take you\non as an added complication! You ﬁll the\n\n\n     house. Or maybe it’s me. I do burn a little\n     cork every time the smell of apple blossoms\n     drifts in the window. I haven’t been burning\n     any lately though.\n\n          john:\n     I could move out. I could just move out.\n\n          violet:\n     Oh no. I want you here for evidence that I’ve\n     gone bad. I think you’ll do the trick. Do\n     you hear a radio in the distance?\n\n          john:\n     Don’t change the subject. Why don’t you wash\n     a few clothes before he gets back? I think\n     cerise would be a nice color for eventide.\n     Shall we mop the skylight?\n\n           violet:\n     What’s the sense? With all these miserable\n     distances and the praying mantises the only\n     people who ever look in. It isn’t as if we\n     had to fear snoops or try to please them.\n     It’s our own little place, for the time being.\n\n          john:\n     I’m afraid Jack will see us before we see him.\n     And then out I’d go like a cloud,\n     lonely for my temporarily own disgusted little\n     ﬂower and playmate, the best on the beach.\n\n          violet:\n     You like to think you’re involved with me\n     emotionally but what you’re involved with\n\n\n\nreally is my lack of suitable clothes to\nmake an impression on the narrow world of\nyour narrow forehead. Some girls would say\nyou’re stupid, but I’m not that patriotic.\nNo, you really are very sweet. Or at least\nyou have been. On occasion.\n\n    john:\nThat was V day and the ﬂags were out.\n\n     violet:\nI know you love me. (They kiss.) I didn’t\nknow you loved me so much. What a magniﬁ­\ncent gesture. I feel like a tube of hot\ncement. What a lover, it’s just like the\nold days when the crows were in the corn\nﬁeld and the rain was in the sky. You do\nmake me happy.\n\n       john:\nBut it upsets me that you’re never happy\nfor long. You know, Vi, I had big plans for\nus. I thought we’d start a pet shop, a\nlittle world of our own full of fondling and\nloyalty and all the tiny things we’ve missed,\nlike ripples on a brook.\n\n       violet:\nYou haven’t talked this way since that after­\nnoon in Arlington Cemetery when the football\ngame was being broadcast over the car radio.\nCome off it, you’re no gangster of the sheets.\nWhen I was little I promised myself not to\nfall in love with anyone but the best polo\npony in the western world. Polo is a very\n\n\n\n     interesting sport, second only to duck ﬁghting\n     in polls of national taste. What kind of lip­\n     stick did I have on?\n\n         john:\n     Raspberry. Right?\n\n          violet:\n     I knew you didn’t love me.\n\n         john:\n     You never knew. You don’t know now. You’ll\n     never be able to guess I don’t and I’ll\n     never give you any security on that score.\n     What do you want from life anyway? If you\n     weren’t so elegant in all the intimate areas\n     where a man needs a lilting simplicity we\n     might have ﬂamed like a rubber tire.\n\n           violet:\n     You’re cute as a pumpkin. I wonder what Jack\n     will look like. Do you think he’ll still\n     love me? I hope so. If not, I may have been\n     premature in certain plans I’ve laid for your\n     so sustaining mouth.\n\n         john:\n     You know it isn’t very warm in here.\n\n            violet:\n     I’d like to think about that remark but\n     inattention has become such a habit—\n     it’s interesting and what you say is not.\n     Isn’t that blue I see, poking its nose\n     over the picture frame falling down the\n     side of the moonlit mountain to the east\n\n\nof the capitol? A screaming as of brakes.\nI hope it’s a train, I mean a boat, coming\nin. Maybe Jack will swim down its gang­\nplank into my absent arms like he used to\nat parties. He was the living proof that\nall women are members of the same sex.\n\n      john:\nSo is everybody else.\n\n     violet:\nWell, I guess some\nmen are just more alive than others.\n\n     john:\nI didn’t know you were so fond of this\nmale war bride. You never muttered his\nname by mistake in my palpitating arms at\ncertain moments when the news of the world\nwas noisily grunting through its telescope.\n\n     violet:\nNot by mistake, I didn’t. Like everyone\nconceited, you are not without cause. You\nare by popular consent the best lay within\nthese four walls, and that acclaim shall\nnever be denied you by tender me.\n\n    john:\nMy own!\n\n    violet:\nDearest of all forgotten ones!   (They kiss.)\n\n      john:\nJust think! Twice in one day. Our infatuation\n\n\n     is rearriving. What trouble it will arrange\n     to stir up in the next ten minutes between two\n     oh so troubled and disenchanted hearts!\n\n          violet:\n     Yes. Yes. The trouble I long for. The trouble\n     that keeps me, and shall continue to keep me,\n     from realizing what trouble is. Dear John.\n        (They embrace.)\n\n          john:\n     Hey. What’s this nasty piece of wood stuck\n     In your boobs?\n\n         violet:\n     Uh oh.\n\n          john:\n     Well?\n\n           violet:\n     It’s a letter, a letter from Jack.\n\n          john:\n     Well what are you carrying it around for?\n     Haven’t you read it yet?\n\n          violet:\n     Uh! (She slaps him.)\n\n        john:\n     How come you never showed me this?\n\n         violet:\n     You were never married to him."

Doesn’t it make\nyou marvel at human ambition? Is that a tear?\n\n    violet:\nNot on your life, you silly ass.\nYou can read the letter, don’t carry on. No,\nmaybe you better not. It is my favorite letter.\n\n     john:\nBecause, like all\nsentimental women past their real gift-to-the­\nworld days, you’re in love with your husband.\n  (She dives for him. He grabs and pinions her.)\n\n    john:\nYou want to toss me for who’ll beat up whom?\n\n    violet:\nOh read the damned thing!\n (She breaks away from him and goes to the sculpture. During the letter-reading\n she drapes herself on it as if it represented the absent Jack to her.)\n\n\n\n\n     I don’t know if I’m well dressed enough. Where did\n     I put that rhinestone lavallière I stole from the\n     fairy at the ballet opening? Sit down, you silly\n     slut. You’re not grappling with a stranger. One\n     bite out of you and Jack won’t know you from an\n     ancient Kabuki.\n\n          violet:\n     My hero! You’re right out of a Noh play, aren’t\n     you? Prince Jasmine Jock, himself.\n\n         john:\n     Oh boy, this is great. (Reads:)\n\n     Don’t ever expect me to forget that moment of\n     brilliance when your blue eyes lit the train station\n     like a camera shutter. Your smile was like pink\n     crinoline going through a ringer. Seventeen trains\n     seemed to arrive and to bruisingly depart before I\n     caught my breath sufﬁciently to ask you for a match.\n     And then your perfume hit me like Niagara Falls.\n\n     Asked you for a match? What\n     a relationship! Did he darn your aprons, too?\n     Get this. (Reads:)\n\n     The pressure of being away from you is sometimes more\n     than even the scenery can bear, and it is alarmingly\n     brazen in piling snow over leaves and dark trunks lying\n     across roads where the push of centuries is like a\n     cymbal crashing in the roots of your hair. But I keep\n     on dreaming of you whether awake or asleep as they say\n     in songs, an azure dream. When I wake up, and I wake\n     up every time I think of you, my prick presses against\n\n\n\nmy belly like a log of foreboding, and I’m afraid that\nI’ll die before I feel that thing that you are that\nnobody else is to my body, like a trembling insight\ninto myself and the world I can’t have. A train just\nwent by covered with icy ﬁr trees.

But all I do is bitch and what I mean is\nI love you.\n\nHe has a funny style, doesn’t he ? It seems like a pose\nbut it must be that he isn’t used to writing. He\nwasn’t a journalist or anything, was he? They’re\nsometimes very awkward. I see now; you were hiding\nit from embarrassment!\n\n      violet:\nI know it’s enough for you that you amuse yourself,\nso I won’t complain of my own feelings. I do think I\ndespise you, but not as much as you would wish, or\nI would wish. It’s impossible that I could have\nlived in precisely this airy derangement for this time\nif any irony of yours could touch me deeply. It’s not\nthat I love Jack! I hate my life.\n\n     john:\nPrincess Lonelyhearts.\n\n     violet:\nWell let’s not stop camping. We haven’t seen the last\nof each other, not us, not Little-Dimity-Head-Felt and\nBouncing-Broad-Britches. There’s a tear left in this\nmagniﬁcent vista yet. Just don’t rust the pipes,\n\n\n\n     darling, and don’t bump yourself tripping over the\n     arbutus. It’s that green stuff with the velvet smile\n     that whines.\n\n          john:\n     Dear god, I think that iron gate I put up as a weather\n     vane is creaking. An angel must be arriving.\n     Who do you suppose it could be?\n\n          violet:\n     Well, one thing we have in common: we’re both\n       (primping)\n     beautiful people.\n\n           john:\n     Yes, like a couple of cesspools.\n\n          violet:\n     One season you’re tan, you’re happy, you’re lying\n     beside an ocean, the hedges are shrinking with an\n     opium speciﬁc,\n\n          john:\n     the next you’re losing weight, you’re cold, you’re\n     getting bald, the ﬂoors are sealed against the\n     grovelling handclasp you extend into the bedrooms,\n     underneath the mezzanine.\n\n           violet:\n     And when lust tries to make itself tangible but ends\n     up as the plot of your favorite silent movie over rye\n     and water under a slippery overhead mist, you want\n     that stranger you always awaited to hurry up, the\n     one you told everybody was an old friend who’d be\n     along in a minute.\n\n\n\nA merchandise man from Chicago?\n\n     violet:\nNo,\nmaybe an opera star who’s retired for love.\n\n    (They retire offstage amorously. jack enters and stands silently looking\n    around. violet and john re-enter with a certain post-coitus detachment from\n    each other.

Do\nyou know why they had to put ﬁre\nunder my lids?\n\n\n\n\n     He is like his letters!\n\n          violet:\n     Shut up.\n\n            jack:\n     When we ﬁrst went\n     riding, how like dashing Cossacks!\n     It was easy then to dress in scarlet.\n     I sat my mount prettily and hacked\n     babies and old women with a song\n     on my breast—I even let my eyebrows\n     grow! and with the gold braid and all\n     I frightened myself. There were sweet\n     times and we weren’t too drunk to\n     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved\n     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say\n     my color was good. I had a beautiful horse.\n     Why, I thought of myself as\n     Eric’s son, Lief, going towards\n     the moon with a world behind me\n     and a lot of blood to get off my\n     chest. I wanted to bellow the green\n     and black waves ﬂat and then\n     cleave my way like an iceberg! I was\n     good and I knew it. I hadn’t laid\n     them all low for nothing: women\n     and villages, coasts of islands\n     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t\n     they all squat when I frowned, even\n     my bad old father ? But something\n     went wrong. One minute I was lord of\n     all I surveyed, and the next I knew\n     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better\n     go back to my easy throne, and leave\n\n\nthis virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid\nheavy hands upon. That was a\nretreat! how I cried to shove off\nfrom that rich tough land, my\nkind of country! and go home.\nWhat was it that beat me? The land,\nthe air, the sun, all bigger than the\ngods intended me to own? I yearned after it,\nand it grew like a spiral as I thought\nthrough the years of my Vinland the Good.\n   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)\nOr if I was the\nAdmiral, bossing a bothersome crew\nand pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,\nwhen suddenly there was a hint of glory!\nI didn’t believe it, just because the\nseaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew\nI might be feverish and I didn’t want to\nbe taken in, but there was something in the\nair—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when\nyou were looking for a baseball—and at\nthe same time I was scared at not knowing,\nit was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,\nI wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could\nknock me down, all those others who wanted\neverything as much as I did.\n\n     john:\nDo I wake or sleep?\n\n     violet:\nI don’t know.\nI’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s\nbeen away all along.

Get out!\n     (But she throws herself into john’s arms and cries.)\n\n          john:\n     There, there.\n        (He looks over her head at jack.)\n     What have you done to my poor baby to confuse her?\n     Why didn’t you send us a telegram to expect you?\n     It was quite a shock to see you. I never saw you before,\n     so you can imagine how it’s tested my equanimity.\n\n          jack:\n     Shock! I come home to ﬁnd you both in your\n     underwear in this place that looks like the\n     landscape outside a bottle factory, and you ask\n     me why I’m not more considerate of the woman who’s\n     been eating my brain for years in the salt mines\n\nof the heart, its panic? That’s where all the wars\nrage, you know. That’s where all the despatches\ncome from. It’s never a matter of killing, it’s\na matter of suffering, it starts blowing up.\nI want her, that’s all, I want her breasts\nleaning into my armpit against shop windows on\nSundays, I want the empty smell of her ﬂesh\nin the morning when she’s gotten up to go to\nthe bathroom, I want her whole open valley\nbreathing noisily when we’re drunk in the wet\nmist of dawn as the pennants begin to stripe\nthemselves and the wind whines towards the\nsuburbs. You can’t have her.\n\n     john:\nYou’re wrong.\nShe wants me, because she’s interested enough\nto hurt me. Life went to the trouble of putting\nme here in these old but well-worn clothes\nthat’ve seen better days and better hers\nand never even wanted to go away and get ﬁxed up.\nYou’ve got a claim on it, but I’ve got it.\nThese things don’t happen temporarily.\n\n      violet:\nI love you.\n   (Against his neck.)\n\n      jack:\nWhat did I do wrong? What’s happened to me? It’s\nlike coming onto the stage, sitting down at the piano,\nand ﬁnding no orchestra there! Why feel guilty, if\nwhat I’ve done doesn’t mean anything, if what I’ve said\ndoesn’t move you? I held you in my heart, like a charm—\n\n     john:\nI suppose I’m the snake-in-the-grass but\nI can’t say I’m sorry. Someone has to smile\n\n     at her as she comes back from the bathroom.\n     Do you think everything can stay the same,\n     like a photograph? What for?\n        (jack starts to exit slowly.)\n\n           violet:\n     I would like to ﬁll a jungle\n     with elephants and gorillas and\n     boa constrictors. I would like\n     to ﬁll the trees and waterfalls\n     with the blackness in me, so I\n     might be a bird of paradise.\n\n     It would be fun to break a bottle\n     of wine and have it turn to water.\n     Or shoot a clay pigeon and have it\n     go honk! honk! and lay an egg in\n     the marshes. I’d rather not be\n     a wedding guest.\n\n     If I were the sphinx I could lie\n     in the sun and stare at myself\n     with pure white eyes. When I smiled\n     airplanes would go off their courses.\n     I’d hold down the dark and say\n     sweet nothings to the palms.\n        (He takes her in his arms.)\n\n         john:\n     Honey, I designed that costume for you.\n     You always look that way to me.\n     That’s why I’m so mean.\n\n          (curtain)"

Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?\n\n     I am the least difﬁcult of men. All I want is boundless love.\n\n     Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just\nlike a pile of leaves.\n\n     However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nos­\ntalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the\nconﬁnes of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of\ngrass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that\npeople do not totally regret life. It is more important to afﬁrm the least sincere; the\nclouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what\nthey’re missing? Uh huh.\n\n    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­\nnate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always\nlooking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and\nthat makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,\nbrown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.\nOn the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as\nthe sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can\nspare myself little sleep.\n\n     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you\nare inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)\n\n    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in\nDostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you\nin the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the\necstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a\n\nhyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is\npumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may\nbecome famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.\n\n    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!\n\n    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the\ntrap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.\n\n      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that\nlittle Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.\n—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­\nping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.\n\n     I’ve got to get out of here.

It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t\nbe any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the mountains in new york\n\n\n      Yes! yes! yes!

All\n      night I sit on the outspread knees\n      of addicts; their kindness\n      makes them talk like whores to\n      the sun as it moves me hysterically\n      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp\n      overlooking the East River, the towers!\n      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way back to the houses\nﬁlled with dirt. My master died\nin my heart on the molten streets.\n\nEveryone is drinking and falling\nand the sour smiles of the wheels\nand the curses of ambitious love.\nI remember Moscow\nI remember two herdsmen in fur caps\nand they were lying down together\nin the snow of their natural ferocity\nwhich warded off the wolves.\nBut now no kisses reassure the animals\nof my tent, and they wander drunkenly away\nand I wander drunkenly here, clouded,\nand I see no face to follow down the streets\nthrough the gates of a great city\nI was building to house the myth of my love.\nI take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue\nand it receives the ﬂaming sibilance\nof the Volga. I am murmuring\npast my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black\nat last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.\nMy head is hot here in the snow and I dart\nrebellious looks into the severely hidden\nbootless snow. My own youth has narrowed\nlike a knife which cures the pleasures of life.\n\nI shall never return! though I twist, come back,\ngrow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.\nI cannot give myself now, I can only rush\n\n\n\n\n     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!\n     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,\n     but you are gone, and I follow.\n\n     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.\n     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.\n     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!\n     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered\n     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?\n     I could have stayed forever in your arms.\n     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!\n     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes\n     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque\n     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.\n     It is raining.

Well I was born to dance.\n   It’s a sacred duty, like being in love with an ape,\n   and eventually I’ll reach some great conclusion, like assumption,\n   when at last I meet exhaustion in these ﬂowers, go straight up."

her bathroom door\n\n                    there was nobody there\n                    there never was anybody\n                    there at any time\n                    in sweet-smelling summer\n\nI’d like to stay\n                    in this ﬁeld forever\n                                                and think of nothing\nbut these sounds,\n                    these smells and the tickling grasses\n                                                “up your ass, Sport”\n\n\n                    Up on the mountainous hill\n                    behind the confusing house\n                       where I lived, I went each\n                       day after school and some nights\n                       with my various dogs, the\n                       terrier that bit people, Arno\n                       the shepherd (who used to\n                       be wild but had stopped), the\n                       wire-haired that took ﬁts\n                       and ﬁnally the boring gentle\n                       cocker, spotted brown and white,\n                        named Freckles        there,\n\n                       the wind sounded exactly like\n                       Stravinsky\n                                   I ﬁrst recognized art\n                       as wildness, and it seemed right,\n                                   I mean rite, to me\n\n                       climbing the water tower I’d\n                       look out for hours in wind\n                       and the world seemed rounder\n                       and ﬁercer and I was happier\n                       because I wasn’t scared of falling off\n\n                       nor off the horses, the horses!\n                       to hell with the horses, bay and black\n\n            It’s odd to have secrets at an early age, trysts\n      whose thoughtfulness and sweetness are those of a very aggressive person\n                 carried beneath your shirt like an amulet against your sire\n                    what one must do is done in a red twilight\n                           on colossally old and dirty furniture with knobs,\n                    and on Sunday afternoons you meet in a high place\n                    watching the Sunday drivers and the symphonic sadness\n                 stopped, a man in a convertible put his hand up a girl’s skirt\n             and again the twitching odor of hay, like a minor irritation\n      that gives you a hardon, and again the roundness of horse noises\n\n\n           “Je suis las de vivre au pays natal”\n                  but unhappiness, like Mercury, transﬁxed me\n           there, un repaire de vipères\n                  and had I known the strength and durability\nof those invisible bonds I would have leaped from rafters onto prongs\nthen\n          and been carried shining and intact\n          to the Indian Cemetery near the lake\n                                                          but there is a glistening\n                                                          blackness in the center\n                                                          if you seek it\nhere . . .     it’s capable of bursting\n               into ﬂame or merely\n               gleaming profoundly in\n                                                          the platinum setting\n                                                          of your ornamental\n                                                          human ties and hates\nhanging between breasts\n                              or, crosslike, on a chest of hairs\nthe center of myself is never silent\n                                             the wind soars, keening overhead\nand the vestments of unnatural safety\n                                             part to reveal a foreign land\ntoward whom I have been selected to bear\n                                                  the gift of ﬁre\n                      the temporary place of light, the land of air\n\ndown where a ﬂame illumines gravity and means warmth and insight,\n     where air is ﬂesh, where speed is darkness\nand\n     things can suddenly be reached, held, dropped and known\n\nwhere a not totally imaginary ascent can begin all over again in tears\n\n\n         A couple of speciﬁcally anguished days\n         make me now distrust sorrow, simple sorrow\n         especially, like sorrow over death\n              it makes you wonder who you are to be sorrowful\n              over death, death belonging to another\n              and suddenly inhabited by you without permission\n\n              you moved in impulsively and took it up\n              declaring your Squatters’ Rights in howls\n              or screaming with rage, like a parvenu in a Chinese laundry\n\n              disbelieving your own feelings is the worst\n              and you suspect that you are jealous of this death\n\n                YIPPEE! I’m glad I’m alive\n                                                “I’m glad you’re alive\n            too, baby, because I want to fuck you”\n                                                     you are pink\n            and despicable in the warm breeze drifting in the window\n      and the rent\n                     is due, in honor of which you have borrowed $34.96 from Joe\n      and it’s all over but the smoldering hatred of pleasure\n            a gorgeous purple like somebody’s favorite tie\n                “Shit, that means you’re getting kind of ascetic, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n                       So I left, the stars were shining\n                       like the lights around a swimming pool\n\n                        you’ve seen a lot of anemones, too\n                        haven’t you, Old Paint? through the\n                        Painted Desert to the orange covered\n                        slopes where a big hill was moving in\n                        on L A and other stars were strolling\n                        in shorts down palm-stacked horse-walks\n                        and I stared with my strained SP stare\n                        wearing a gun\n                                        the doubts\n              of a life devoted to leaving rumors of love for new\n      from does she love me to do I love him,"

Don’t be so rude, you are\n      only the second poet I’ve ever chosen\n      to speak to personally\n                               so why\n      aren’t you more attentive?

of his prized rose plants\nyak, yak it’s a wonderful life for the plants\n\nwhen you think of what Shelley did with such a theme\nand long afterwards Mallarmé reciting it to himself\nfar across the channel in all that loneliness and stren’th\nyou wonder if I shouldn’t be back on the phone getting black ear\ndon’t you? well, back to your novel, wench! assez\n\nyou and Marisol, the Grace Kelly and Maria Callas\nof the New York School, I do wish that clematis had growed\nI don’t know what happened, I guess I just lost interest\nwhich along with the current recession ﬁlls me with guilt\nand besides I was a kid, as now I can hardly be made responsible\nfor the money troubles of our nation, almost never\nhaving seen any, but the plant in your life\n\nis the plant that died, “mourir, c’est

Sibelius’s with a cigar\n            it was red it was strange and hateful\n            and then I became a child again\n            like a nadir or a zenith or a nudnik\n\n            what do you think this is my youth\n            and the aged future that is sweeping me away\n            carless and gasless under the Sutton\n            and Beekman Places towards a hellish rage\n            it is there that face I fear under ramps\n\n            it is perhaps the period that ends\n            the problem as a proposition of days of days\n            just an attack on the feelings that stay\n            poised in the hurricane’s center that\n            eye through which only camels can pass\n\n            but I do not mean that tenderness doesn’t\n            linger like a Paris afternoon or a wart\n            something dumb and despicable that I love\n            because it is silent oh what difference\n            does it make me into some kind of space statistic\n\n            a lot is buried under that smile\n            a lot of sophistication gone down the drain\n            to become the mesh of a mythical ﬁsh\n            at which we never stare back never stare back\n            where there is so much downright forgery\n\n\n\nunder that I ﬁnd it restful like a bush\nsome people are outraged by cleanliness\nI hate the lack of smells myself and yet I stay\nit is better than being actually present\nand the stare can swim away into the past\n\ncan adorn it with easy convictions rat\ncow tiger rabbit dragon snake horse sheep\nmonkey rooster dog and pig “Flower Drum Song”\nso that nothing is vain not the gelded sand\nnot the old spangled lotus not my ﬂy\n\nwhich I have thought about but never really\nlooked at well that’s a certain orderliness\nof personality “if you’re brought up Protestant\nenough a Catholic” oh shit on the beaches so\nwhat if I did look up your trunks and see it\n\n     ii\nthen the parallel becomes an eagle parade\nof Busby Berkeleyites marching marching half-toe\nI suppose it’s the happiest moment in inﬁnity\nbecause we’re dissipated and tired and fond no\nI don’t think psychoanalysis shrinks the spleen\n\nhere we are and what the hell are we going to do\nwith it we are going to blow it up like daddy did\nonly us I really think we should go up for a change\nI’m tired of always going down what price glory\nit’s one of those timeless priceless words like come\n\nwell now how does your conscience feel about that\nwould you rather explore tomorrow with a sponge\nthere’s no need to look for a target you’re it\nlike in childhood when the going was aimed at a\nsandwich it all depends on which three of us are there\n\n\n      but here come the prophets with their loosening nails\n      it is only as blue as the lighting under the piles\n      I have something portentous to say to you but which\n      of the papier-mâché languages do you understand you\n      don’t dare to take it off paper much less put it on\n\n      yes it is strange that everyone fucks and every\n      one mentions it and it’s boring too that faded ﬂoor\n      how many teeth have chewed a little piece of the lover’s\n      ﬂesh how many teeth are there in the world it’s like\n      Harpo Marx smiling at a million pianos call that Africa\n\n      call it New Guinea call it Poughkeepsie I guess\n      it’s love I guess the season of renunciation is at “hand”\n      the ﬁnal fatal hour of turpitude and logic demise\n      is when you miss getting rid of something delouse\n      is when you don’t louse something up which way is the inn\n\n            iii\n      I’m looking for a million-dollar heart in a carton\n      of frozen strawberries like the Swedes where is sunny England\n      and those ﬁelds where they stillbirth the wars why\n      did they suddenly stop playing why is Venice a Summer\n      Festival and not New York were you born in America\n\n      the inscrutable passage of a lawn mower punctuates\n      the newly installed Muzak in the Shubert Theatre am I nuts\n      or is this the happiest moment of my life who’s arguing it’s\n      I mean ’tis lawd sakes it took daddy a long time to have\n      that accident so Ant Grace could get completely into black\n\n      didn’t you know we was all going to be Zen Buddhists after\n      what we did you sure don’t know much about war-guilt\n      or nothin and the peach trees continued to rejoice around\n      the prick which was for once authorized by our Congress\n      though inactive what if it had turned out to be a volcano\n\n\nthat’s a mulatto of another nationality of marble\nit’s time for dessert I don’t care what street this is\nyou’re not telling me to take a tour are you\nI don’t want to look at any ﬁngernails or any toes\nI just want to go on being subtle and dead like life\n\nI’m not naturally so detached but I think\nthey might send me up any minute so I try to be free\nyou know we’ve all sinned a lot against science\nso we really ought to be available as an apple on a bough\npleasant thought fresh air free love cross-pollenization\n\noh oh god how I’d love to dream let alone sleep it’s night\nthe soft air wraps me like a swarm it’s raining and I have\na cold I am a real human being with real ascendancies\nand a certain amount of rapture what do you do with a kid\nlike me if you don’t eat me I’ll have to eat myself\n\nit’s a strange curse my “generation” has we’re all\nlike the ﬂowers in the Agassiz Museum perpetually ardent\ndon’t touch me because when I tremble it makes a noise\nlike a Chinese wind-bell it’s that I’m seismographic is all\nand when a Jesuit has stared you down for ever after you clink\n\nI wonder if I’ve really scrutinized this experience like\nyou’re supposed to have if you can type there’s not much\nsoup left on my sleeve energy creativity guts ponderableness\nlent is coming in imponderableness “I’d like to die smiling” ugh\nand a very small tiptoe is crossing the threshold away\n\nwhither Lumumba whither oh whither Gauguin\nI have often tried to say goodbye to strange fantoms I\nread about in the newspapers and have always succeeded\nthough the ones at “home” are dependent on Dependable\nLaboratory and Sales Company on Pulaski Street strange\n\n\n\n      I think it’s goodbye to a lot of things like Christmas\n      and the Mediterranean and halos and meteorites and villages\n      full of damned children well it’s goodbye then as in Strauss\n      or some other desperately theatrical venture it’s goodbye\n      to lunch to love to evil things and to the ultimate good as “well”\n\n      the strange career of a personality begins at ﬁve and ends\n      forty minutes later in a fog the rest is just a lot of stranded\n      ships honking their horns full of joy-seeking cadets in bloomers\n      and beards it’s okay with me but must they cheer while they honk\n      it seems that breath could easily ﬁll a balloon and drift away\n\n      scaring the locusts in the straggling grey of living dumb\n      exertions then the useful noise would come of doom of data\n      turned to elegant decoration like a strangling prince once ordered\n      no there is no precedent of history no history nobody came before\n      nobody will ever come before and nobody ever was that man\n\n      you will not die not knowing this is true this year"
