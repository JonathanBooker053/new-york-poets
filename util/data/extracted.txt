autobiographia literaria


  When I was a child
  I played by myself in a
  corner of the schoolyard
  all alone.

  I hated dolls and I
  hated games, animals were
  not friendly and birds
  ﬂew away.

  If anyone was looking
  for me I hid behind a
  tree and cried out “I am
  an orphan.”

  And here I am, the
  center of all beauty!
  writing these poems!
  Imagine!

                poem


    At night Chinamen jump
    on Asia with a thump

    while in our willful way
    we, in secret, play

    affectionate games and bruise
    our knees like China’s shoes.

    The birds push apples through
    grass the moon turns blue,

    these apples roll beneath
    our buttocks like a heath

    full of Chinese thrushes
    ﬂushed from China’s bushes.

    As we love at night
    birds sing out of sight,

    Chinese rhythms beat
    through us in our heat,

    the apples and the birds
    move us like soft words,

    we couple in the grace
    of that mysterious race.

                        poem


The eager note on my door said “Call me,
call when you get in!” so I quickly threw
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and

headed straight for the door. It was autumn
by the time I got around the corner, oh all
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk!

Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a
champion jai-alai player like himself ? Oh ﬁe!
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was

there in the hall, ﬂat on a sheet of blood that
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest
only casually invited, and that several months ago.

    Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas!
    You really are beautiful! Pearls,
    harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! all
    the stuff they’ve always talked about

    still makes a poem a surprise!
    These things are with us every day
    even on beachheads and biers. They
    do have meaning. They’re strong as rocks.

              memorial day 1950


Picasso made me tough and quick, and the world;
just as in a minute plane trees are knocked down
outside my window by a crew of creators.
Once he got his axe going everyone was upset
enough to ﬁght for the last ditch and heap
of rubbish.
             Through all that surgery I thought
I had a lot to say, and named several last things
Gertrude Stein hadn’t had time for; but then
the war was over, those things had survived
and even when you’re scared art is no dictionary.
Max Ernst told us that.
                           How many trees and frying pans
I loved and lost! Guernica hollered look out!
but we were all busy hoping our eyes were talking
to Paul Klee. My mother and father asked me and
I told them from my tight blue pants we should
love only the stones, the sea, and heroic ﬁgures.
Wasted child! I’ll club you on the shins! I
wasn’t surprised when the older people entered
my cheap hotel room and broke my guitar and my can
of blue paint.
                At that time all of us began to think
with our bare hands and even with blood all over
them, we knew vertical from horizontal, we never
smeared anything except to ﬁnd out how it lived.
Fathers of Dada! You carried shining erector sets
in your rough bony pockets, you were generous
and they were lovely as chewing gum or ﬂowers!
Thank you!
               And those of us who thought poetry
was crap were throttled by Auden or Rimbaud
when, sent by some compulsive Juno, we tried
to play with collages or sprechstimme in their bed.
Poetry didn’t tell me not to play with toys

    but alone I could never have ﬁgured out that dolls
    meant death.
                   Our responsibilities did not begin
    in dreams, though they began in bed. Love is ﬁrst of all
    a lesson in utility. I hear the sewage singing
    underneath my bright white toilet seat and know
    that somewhere sometime it will reach the sea:
    gulls and swordﬁshes will ﬁnd it richer than a river.
    And airplanes are perfect mobiles, independent
    of the breeze; crashing in ﬂames they show us how
    to be prodigal. O Boris Pasternak, it may be silly
    to call to you, so tall in the Urals, but your voice
    cleans our world, clearer to us than the hospital:
    you sound above the factory’s ambitious gargle.
    Poetry is as useful as a machine!
                                         Look at my room.
    Guitar strings hold up pictures. I don’t need
    a piano to sing, and naming things is only the intention
    to make things. A locomotive is more melodious
    than a cello. I dress in oil cloth and read music
    by Guillaume Apollinaire’s clay candelabra. Now
    my father is dead and has found out you must look things
    in the belly, not in the eye. If only he had listened
    to the men who made us, hollering like stuck pigs!

Sometimes I know I love you better
than all the others I kiss it’s funny

but it’s true and I wouldn’t roll
from one to the next so fast if you

hadn’t knocked them all down like
ninepins when you roared by my bed


I keep trying to race ahead and catch

       I picked up a leaf
       today from the sidewalk.
       This seems childish.

       Leaf ! you are so big!
       How can you change your
       color, then just fall!

       As if there were no
       such thing as integrity!

       You are too relaxed
       to answer me. I am too
       frightened to insist.

       like the small chameleon.

        light is bright enough
        to read by it is a warm
        friendly day I am feeling
        assertive. I slip a few
        poems into the pelican’s
        bill and he is off ! out
        the window into the blue!

        The editor is delighted I
        hear his clamor for more
        but that is nothing. Ah!
        reader! you open the page
        my poems stare at you you
        stare back, do you not? my
        poems speak on the silver
        of your eyes your eyes repeat
        them to your lover’s this
        very night. Over your naked
        shoulder the improving stars
        read my poems and ﬂash
        them onward to a friend.

        world are changed! Pelican!

     Have you forgotten what we were like then
     when we were still ﬁrst rate
     and the day came fat with an apple in its mouth

     it’s no use worrying about Time
     but we did have a few tricks up our sleeves
     and turned some sharp corners

     the whole pasture looked like our meal
     we didn’t need speedometers
     we could manage cocktails out of ice and water

     I wouldn’t want to be faster
     or greener than now if you were with me O you

  I think a lot about
  the Peachums: Polly
  and all the rest are
  free and fair. Her jewels
  have price tags in case
  they want to change
  hands, and her pets
  are carnivorous. Even
  the birds.
            Whenever our
  splendid hero Mackie
  Messer, what an honest
  man! steals or kills, there
  is meaning for you! Oh
  Mackie’s knife has a false
  handle so it can express
  its meaning as well as
  his. Mackie’s not one to
  impose his will. After all
  who does own any thing?

  But Polly, are you a
  shadow? Is Mackie projected
  to me by light through ﬁlm?
  If I’d been in Berlin in
  1930, would I have seen you
  ambling the streets like
  Krazy Kat?
               Oh yes. Why,
  when Mackie speaks we
  only know what he means
  occasionally. His sentence
  is an image of the times.
  You’d have seen all of us
  masquerading. Chipper; but
  not so well arranged. Air­
  ing old poodles and pre-war

 The cinema is cruel
 like a miracle. We
 sit in the darkened
 room asking nothing
 of the empty white
 space but that it
 remain pure. And
 suddenly despite us
 it blackens. Not by
 the hand that holds
 the pen. There is
 no message. We our­
 selves appear naked
 on the river bank
 spread-eagled while
 the machine wings
 nearer. We scream
 chatter prance and
 wash our hair! Is
 it our prayer or
 wish that this
 occur? Oh what is
 this light that
 holds us fast? Our
 limbs quicken even
 to disgrace under
 this white eye as
 if there were real
 pleasure in loving
 a shadow and caress­
 ing a disguise!

     If I knew exactly why the chestnut tree
     seems about to ﬂame or die, its pyramids

     aquiver, would I tell you? Perhaps not.
     We must keep interested in foreign stamps,

     railway schedules, baseball scores, and
     abnormal psychology, or all is lost. I

     could tell you too much for either of us
     to bear, and I suppose you might answer

     in kind. It is a terrible thing to feel
     like a picnicker who has forgotten his lunch.

     And everything will take care of itself,
     it got along without us before. But god

     did it all then! And now it’s our tree
     going up in ﬂames, still blossoming, as if

     it had nothing better to do! Don’t we have
     a duty to it, as if it were a gold mine

     we fell into climbing desert mountains,
     or a dirty child, or a fatal abscess?

I cannot possibly think of you
other than you are: the assassin

of my orchards. You lurk there
in the shadows, meting out

conversation like Eve’s ﬁrst
confusion between penises and

snakes. Oh be droll, be jolly
and be temperate! Do not

frighten me more than you
have to! I must live forever.

     The only way to be quiet
     is to be quick, so I scare
     you clumsily, or surprise
     you with a stab. A praying
     mantis knows time more
     intimately than I and is
     more casual. Crickets use
     time for accompaniment to
     innocent ﬁdgeting. A zebra
     races counterclockwise.
     All this I desire. To
     deepen you by my quickness
     and delight as if you
     were logical and proven,
     but still be quiet as if
     I were used to you; as if
     you would never leave me
     and were the inexorable
     product of my own time.

I’m going to New York!
(what a lark! what a song!)
where the tough Rocky’s eaves
hit the sea. Where th’Acro­
polis is functional, the trains
that run and shout! the books
that have trousers and sleeves!

I’m going to New York!
(quel voyage! jamais plus!)
far from Ypsilanti and Flint!
where Goodman rules the Empire
and the sunlight’s eschato­
logy upon the wizard’s bridges
and the galleries of print!

I’m going to New York!
(to my friends! mes semblables!)
I suppose I’ll walk back West.
But for now I’m gone forever!

     I took! Don’t stand around
     my bedroom making things cry

     any more! I’m not going to
     thrash the ﬂoor or throw any
     apples! To hell with the radio,
     let it rot! I’m not going to be

     the monster in my own bed
     any more!” Well. The silence
     was too easily arrived at; most
     oppressive. The pictures swung

     on the wall with boredom and
     the plants imagined us all in
     Trinidad. I was crowded with
     windows. I raced to the door.

     “Come back” I cried “for a minute!
     You left your new shoes. And the
     coffee pot’s yours!” There were no
     footsteps. Wow! what a relief !

The eagerness of objects to
be what we are afraid to do

cannot help but move us        Is
this willingness to be a motive

in us what we reject?      The
really stupid things, I mean

a can of coffee, a 35¢ ear
ring, a handful of hair, what

do these things do to us?   We
come into the room, the windows

      Violet leaped to the piano
      stool and knees drawn up
      under her chin commenced to
      spin faster and faster sing­
      ing “I’m a little Dutch boy
      Dutch boy Dutch boy” until
      the rain very nearly fell
      through the roof !
                           while, from
      the other end of the room,
      Jane, her eyeballs like the
      crystal of a seer spattering
      my already faunish cheeks
      with motes of purest colored
      good humor, advanced slowly.

      “Poo!” said Hal “they are
      far too elegant to be let
      off the pedestal even for a
      night” but Jack quickly and
      rather avariciously amended
      “it’s her birthday,” then
      fell deliberatively silent
      as
         Larry paced the ﬂoor. Oh
      Larry! “Ouch” he cried (the
      latter) “the business isn’t
      very good between Boston and
      New York! when I’m not paint

      not writing I’m suffering

     What a hot day it is! for
     Jane and me above the scorch
     of sun on jungle waters to be
     paddling up and down the Essequibo
     in our canoe of war-surplus gondola parts.

     We enjoy it, though: the bats squeak
     in our wrestling hair, parakeets
     bungle lightly into gorges of blossom,
     the water’s full of gunk and
     what you might call waterlilies if you’re

     silly as we. Our intuitive craft
     our striped T shirts and shorts
     cry out to vines that are feasting
     on ﬂies to make straight the way
     of tropical art. “I’d give a lempira or two

     to have it all slapped onto a
     canvas” says Jane. “How like
     lazy ﬂamingos look the ﬂoating
     weeds! and the infundibuliform
     corolla on our right’s a harmless Charybdis!

     or am I seduced by its ambient
     mauve?” The nose of our vessel sneezes
     into a bundle of amaryllis, quite
     artiﬁcially tied with ribbon.
     Are there people nearby? and postcards?

     We, essentially travellers, frown
     and backwater. What will the savages
     think if our friends turn up? with
     sunglasses and cuneiform decoders!
     probably. Oh Jane, is there no more frontier?

We strip off our pretty blazers
of tapa and dive like salamanders
into the vernal stream. Alas! they
have left the jungle aﬂame, and in
friendly chatter of Kotzebue and Salonika our

friends swiftly retreat downstream
on a ﬂowery ﬂoat. We strike through
the tongues and tigers hotly, towards
orange mountains, black taboos, dada!
and clouds. To return with absolute treasure!

our only penchant, that. And a red
billed toucan, pointing t’aurora highlands
and caravanserais of junk, cries out
“New York is everywhere like Paris!

Those were desperate days too, but I’d no more
give up our silver mine, Belle, just because gold
has become the world standard look, than all
your grey hairs, beloved New York from whence
all the loathsome sirens don’t call. They would like
to take you away from me wouldn’t they? now that the fever’s
got me and there’re rumors of a Rush in California
and pine ﬁelds in Massachusetts as yet unindustrialized.
That’s how they act to The American Boy
from Sodom-on-Hudson (non-resident membership
in The Museum of Modern Art) as if it weren’t the best
little municipality in the U.S. with real estate
rising like a coloratura, no road sighs, and self-plumbing;
and more damned vistas of tundra than Tivoli
has dolce far niente. It’s me, though, not the city—

     Yes, the mathematicians applauded when the senator
     proved that god never sent cablegrams or disappeared
     except when voodoo or political expediency ﬂourished,
     it being sweet times, in Tammany in the 90s
     and before one hated to seem too cocky or too ritzy.
     One thought a good deal then of riding for pleasures
     and in shrubbery of a casual ﬁstﬁght Vesuvius smarting
     and screaming creamed rubily as if to ﬂush the heavens.
     As the glassy fencing of sunrise in a ﬁsh market
     cries out its Americanism and jingoes and jolts daily
     over the icebergs of our historically wispy possum-drowsy
     lack of antiquity, we know that art must be vulgar to say
     “Never may the dame claim to be warm to the exact,
     nor the suburban community amount to anything in any way
     that is not a pursuit of the purple vices artsy-craftsy,
     the loom in the sitting room where reading is only aloud
     and illustrative of campﬁre meetings beside the Out Doors
     where everyone feels as ill at ease as sea-food.”

     Often I think of your voice against the needles of dawn
     when the dampness was operatic in Ann Arbor lilacs
     and the gold of my ﬂesh had yet to be regimented in freckles.
     Now I must face the glass of whatever sliver’s my smile,

28
each day more demanding me for what I have always tossed aside
like listening to Erwartung hanging by your thumbs;
I turn grey over night screaming feverishly scoreful, note
for note as I have always believed, for I know what I love
and know what must be trodden under foot to be vindicated
and gloriﬁed and praised: Belle of Old New York
your desperation will never open in La Forza del Destino
which was my father’s favorite opera when he tried to jump
out a window on New Year’s Eve in 1940, thirty days
before I ditched the stable boy who gave me the diamonds
I’m turning in today for a little freedom to travel.

     The white chocolate jar full of petals
     swills odds and ends around in a dizzying eye
     of four o’clocks now and to come. The tiger,
     marvellously striped and irritable; leaps
     on the table and without disturbing a hair
     of the ﬂowers’ breathless attention, pisses
     into the pot, right down its delicate spout.
     A whisper of steam goes up from that porcelain
     urethra. “Saint-Saëns!” it seems to be whispering,
     curling unerringly around the furry nuts
     of the terrible puss, who is mentally ﬂexing.
     Ah be with me always, spirit of noisy
     contemplation in the studio, the Garden
     of Zoos, the eternally ﬁxed afternoons!
     There, while music scratches its scrofulous
     stomach, the brute beast emerges and stands,
     clear and careful, knowing always the exact peril
     at this moment caressing his fangs with
     a tongue given wholly to luxurious usages;
     which only a moment before dropped aspirin
     in this sunset of roses, and now throws a chair
     in the air to aggravate the truly menacing.

Always so. They were so fond of eating bread and butter and

     Summer is over,
     that moment of blindness
     in a sunny wheelbarrow
     aching on sand dunes
     from a big melancholy
     about war headlines
     and personal hatreds.

     Restful boredom waits
     for the winter’s cold solace
     and biting season of galas
     to take over my nerves,
     and from anger at time’s
     rough passage I ﬁght
     off the future, my friend.

     Is there at all anywhere
     in this lavender sky
     beside the UN Building
     where I am so little
     and have dallied with love,
     a fragment of the paradise
     we see when signing treaties
     or planning free radio stations?

     If I turn down my sheets
     children start screaming through
     the windows. My glasses
     are broken on the coffee table.
     And at night a truce
     with Iran or Korea seems certain
     while I am beaten to death
     by a thug in a back bedroom.

Whole days would go by, and later their years,
while I thought of nothing but its darkness
drifting like a bridge against the sky.
Day after day I dreamily sought its melancholy,
its searchings, its soft banks enfolded me,
and upon my lengthening neck its kiss
was murmuring like a wound. My very life
became the inhalation of its weedy ponderings
and sometimes in the sunlight my eyes,
walled in water, would glimpse the pathway
to the great sea. For it was there I was being borne.
Then for a moment my strengthening arms
would cry out upon the leafy crest of the air
like whitecaps, and lightning, swift as pain,
would go through me on its way to the forest,
and I’d sink back upon that brutal tenderness
that bore me on, that held me like a slave
in its liquid distances of eyes, and one day,
though weeping for my caresses, would abandon me,
moment of inﬁnitely salty air! sun ﬂuttering
like a signal! upon the open ﬂesh of the world.

                To Anne Meacham

john
violet
jack

place: A studio.
scene: A room. A war has ended. The two are sitting on an old wicker sofa,
listening to a phonograph record.

      john:
I like songs about hat-check girls,
elevators, bunions, syphilis, all the
old sentimental things. It’s not enough
to be thoughtful, is it?

    violet:
Aren’t you acting terribly prewar?

      john:
My dear, I want you to work hard at
reinstating that wifely melancholy that
made you such a distinctive asset to
anyone “marching off ” as they say. You
used to mourn for him like a model house.
Now the neighbors are all saying you’ve
gone down the drain. All I can say is
what a drain! I prefer to think you were
always a little too nice. “If anyone
cries in the world. . . .

        violet:
. . . it has to be me.” Please stop trying
to cheer me up. Jesus. You’re as relaxing
as a pin. I was a sweet, eager, pretty, and
energetic girl. As he remembers me, so
shall he ﬁnd me. What ever made me take you
on as an added complication! You ﬁll the


                                                                      35
     house. Or maybe it’s me. I do burn a little
     cork every time the smell of apple blossoms
     drifts in the window. I haven’t been burning
     any lately though.

          john:
     I could move out. I could just move out.

          violet:
     Oh no. I want you here for evidence that I’ve
     gone bad. I think you’ll do the trick. Do
     you hear a radio in the distance?

          john:
     Don’t change the subject. Why don’t you wash
     a few clothes before he gets back? I think
     cerise would be a nice color for eventide.
     Shall we mop the skylight?

           violet:
     What’s the sense? With all these miserable
     distances and the praying mantises the only
     people who ever look in. It isn’t as if we
     had to fear snoops or try to please them.
     It’s our own little place, for the time being.

          john:
     I’m afraid Jack will see us before we see him.
     And then out I’d go like a cloud,
     lonely for my temporarily own disgusted little
     ﬂower and playmate, the best on the beach.

          violet:
     You like to think you’re involved with me
     emotionally but what you’re involved with



36
really is my lack of suitable clothes to
make an impression on the narrow world of
your narrow forehead. Some girls would say
you’re stupid, but I’m not that patriotic.
No, you really are very sweet. Or at least
you have been. On occasion.

    john:
That was V day and the ﬂags were out.

     violet:
I know you love me. (They kiss.) I didn’t
know you loved me so much. What a magniﬁ­
cent gesture. I feel like a tube of hot
cement. What a lover, it’s just like the
old days when the crows were in the corn
ﬁeld and the rain was in the sky. You do
make me happy.

       john:
But it upsets me that you’re never happy
for long. You know, Vi, I had big plans for
us. I thought we’d start a pet shop, a
little world of our own full of fondling and
loyalty and all the tiny things we’ve missed,
like ripples on a brook.

       violet:
You haven’t talked this way since that after­
noon in Arlington Cemetery when the football
game was being broadcast over the car radio.
Come off it, you’re no gangster of the sheets.
When I was little I promised myself not to
fall in love with anyone but the best polo
pony in the western world. Polo is a very



                                                 37
     interesting sport, second only to duck ﬁghting
     in polls of national taste. What kind of lip­
     stick did I have on?

         john:
     Raspberry. Right?

          violet:
     I knew you didn’t love me.

         john:
     You never knew. You don’t know now. You’ll
     never be able to guess I don’t and I’ll
     never give you any security on that score.
     What do you want from life anyway? If you
     weren’t so elegant in all the intimate areas
     where a man needs a lilting simplicity we
     might have ﬂamed like a rubber tire.

           violet:
     You’re cute as a pumpkin. I wonder what Jack
     will look like. Do you think he’ll still
     love me? I hope so. If not, I may have been
     premature in certain plans I’ve laid for your
     so sustaining mouth.

         john:
     You know it isn’t very warm in here.

            violet:
     I’d like to think about that remark but
     inattention has become such a habit—
     it’s interesting and what you say is not.
     Isn’t that blue I see, poking its nose
     over the picture frame falling down the
     side of the moonlit mountain to the east


38
of the capitol? A screaming as of brakes.
I hope it’s a train, I mean a boat, coming
in. Maybe Jack will swim down its gang­
plank into my absent arms like he used to
at parties. He was the living proof that
all women are members of the same sex.

      john:
So is everybody else.

     violet:
Well, I guess some
men are just more alive than others.

     john:
I didn’t know you were so fond of this
male war bride. You never muttered his
name by mistake in my palpitating arms at
certain moments when the news of the world
was noisily grunting through its telescope.

     violet:
Not by mistake, I didn’t. Like everyone
conceited, you are not without cause. You
are by popular consent the best lay within
these four walls, and that acclaim shall
never be denied you by tender me.

    john:
My own!

    violet:
Dearest of all forgotten ones!   (They kiss.)

      john:
Just think! Twice in one day. Our infatuation


                                                39
     is rearriving. What trouble it will arrange
     to stir up in the next ten minutes between two
     oh so troubled and disenchanted hearts!

          violet:
     Yes. Yes. The trouble I long for. The trouble
     that keeps me, and shall continue to keep me,
     from realizing what trouble is. Dear John.
        (They embrace.)

          john:
     Hey. What’s this nasty piece of wood stuck
     In your boobs?

         violet:
     Uh oh.

          john:
     Well?

           violet:
     It’s a letter, a letter from Jack.

          john:
     Well what are you carrying it around for?
     Haven’t you read it yet?

          violet:
     Uh! (She slaps him.)

        john:
     How come you never showed me this?

         violet:
     You were never married to him.



40
      john:
When I think of the two of us, frail in our
affections, stranded on this planet of incessant
communication like gophers in their sweet-nosed
paralysis, or more similar to lovers who are very,
very sunburned! I marvel that we ever found it
possible or desirable to raise our lazy heads
from opposite ends of a gray fountain’s inter­
section with the regimented air in order to just
say “Are you having fun?” to the dear person for
whom we are preparing, with passionately efﬁcient
distraction, the deepest hurt, the one we did the
sweetly sweaty and individual push-ups and cold
creamings for, through the years. Doesn’t it make
you marvel at human ambition? Is that a tear?

    violet:
Not on your life, you silly ass.
You can read the letter, don’t carry on. No,
maybe you better not. It is my favorite letter.

     john:
Because, like all
sentimental women past their real gift-to-the­
world days, you’re in love with your husband.
  (She dives for him. He grabs and pinions her.)

    john:
You want to toss me for who’ll beat up whom?

    violet:
Oh read the damned thing!
 (She breaks away from him and goes to the sculpture. During the letter-reading
 she drapes herself on it as if it represented the absent Jack to her.)




                                                                         41
           john:
     I don’t know if I’m well dressed enough. Where did
     I put that rhinestone lavallière I stole from the
     fairy at the ballet opening? Sit down, you silly
     slut. You’re not grappling with a stranger. One
     bite out of you and Jack won’t know you from an
     ancient Kabuki.

          violet:
     My hero! You’re right out of a Noh play, aren’t
     you? Prince Jasmine Jock, himself.

         john:
     Oh boy, this is great. (Reads:)

     Don’t ever expect me to forget that moment of
     brilliance when your blue eyes lit the train station
     like a camera shutter. Your smile was like pink
     crinoline going through a ringer. Seventeen trains
     seemed to arrive and to bruisingly depart before I
     caught my breath sufﬁciently to ask you for a match.
     And then your perfume hit me like Niagara Falls.

     Asked you for a match? What
     a relationship! Did he darn your aprons, too?
     Get this. (Reads:)

     The pressure of being away from you is sometimes more
     than even the scenery can bear, and it is alarmingly
     brazen in piling snow over leaves and dark trunks lying
     across roads where the push of centuries is like a
     cymbal crashing in the roots of your hair. But I keep
     on dreaming of you whether awake or asleep as they say
     in songs, an azure dream. When I wake up, and I wake
     up every time I think of you, my prick presses against



42
my belly like a log of foreboding, and I’m afraid that
I’ll die before I feel that thing that you are that
nobody else is to my body, like a trembling insight
into myself and the world I can’t have. A train just
went by covered with icy ﬁr trees. The sky is white.
I cry at night sometimes with my prick tangled in the
sheets—wishing it would go away and ﬁnd you and leave
me alone in my, in this lousy southern country where
it’s colder in the winter than it ever is in the cold
countries. But all I do is bitch and what I mean is
I love you.

He has a funny style, doesn’t he ? It seems like a pose
but it must be that he isn’t used to writing. He
wasn’t a journalist or anything, was he? They’re
sometimes very awkward. I see now; you were hiding
it from embarrassment!

      violet:
I know it’s enough for you that you amuse yourself,
so I won’t complain of my own feelings. I do think I
despise you, but not as much as you would wish, or
I would wish. It’s impossible that I could have
lived in precisely this airy derangement for this time
if any irony of yours could touch me deeply. It’s not
that I love Jack! I hate my life.

     john:
Princess Lonelyhearts.

     violet:
Well let’s not stop camping. We haven’t seen the last
of each other, not us, not Little-Dimity-Head-Felt and
Bouncing-Broad-Britches. There’s a tear left in this
magniﬁcent vista yet. Just don’t rust the pipes,



                                                          43
     darling, and don’t bump yourself tripping over the
     arbutus. It’s that green stuff with the velvet smile
     that whines.

          john:
     Dear god, I think that iron gate I put up as a weather
     vane is creaking. An angel must be arriving.
     Who do you suppose it could be?

          violet:
     Well, one thing we have in common: we’re both
       (primping)
     beautiful people.

           john:
     Yes, like a couple of cesspools.

          violet:
     One season you’re tan, you’re happy, you’re lying
     beside an ocean, the hedges are shrinking with an
     opium speciﬁc,

          john:
     the next you’re losing weight, you’re cold, you’re
     getting bald, the ﬂoors are sealed against the
     grovelling handclasp you extend into the bedrooms,
     underneath the mezzanine.

           violet:
     And when lust tries to make itself tangible but ends
     up as the plot of your favorite silent movie over rye
     and water under a slippery overhead mist, you want
     that stranger you always awaited to hurry up, the
     one you told everybody was an old friend who’d be
     along in a minute.



44
    john:
A merchandise man from Chicago?

     violet:
No,
maybe an opera star who’s retired for love.

    (They retire offstage amorously. jack enters and stands silently looking
    around. violet and john re-enter with a certain post-coitus detachment from
    each other. After a pause:)

     john:
Are you going to introduce me to the gentleman?

      violet:
Oh Jack! My Jackson!
why did you leave me?
Since you left I’ve had
to sell the ﬂute and the
bathtub. And my voice
just froze. I’ll never again
sing the popular songs
you composed while you were
on. Don’t look at my ﬁngernails.

      jack:
I’ve come a long way for your sake,
my back all decorated like this
and my feet covered with mold. Do
you know why they had to put ﬁre
under my lids?




                                                                       45
          john:
     He is like his letters!

          violet:
     Shut up.

            jack:
     When we ﬁrst went
     riding, how like dashing Cossacks!
     It was easy then to dress in scarlet.
     I sat my mount prettily and hacked
     babies and old women with a song
     on my breast—I even let my eyebrows
     grow! and with the gold braid and all
     I frightened myself. There were sweet
     times and we weren’t too drunk to
     appreciate them. Lovely ladies loved
     us, like useful ﬂowers. And as I say
     my color was good. I had a beautiful horse.
     Why, I thought of myself as
     Eric’s son, Lief, going towards
     the moon with a world behind me
     and a lot of blood to get off my
     chest. I wanted to bellow the green
     and black waves ﬂat and then
     cleave my way like an iceberg! I was
     good and I knew it. I hadn’t laid
     them all low for nothing: women
     and villages, coasts of islands
     twice as big as Iceland. And didn’t
     they all squat when I frowned, even
     my bad old father ? But something
     went wrong. One minute I was lord of
     all I surveyed, and the next I knew
     that I’d be beaten—that I’d better
     go back to my easy throne, and leave


46
this virgin land I’d ﬁrst laid
heavy hands upon. That was a
retreat! how I cried to shove off
from that rich tough land, my
kind of country! and go home.
What was it that beat me? The land,
the air, the sun, all bigger than the
gods intended me to own? I yearned after it,
and it grew like a spiral as I thought
through the years of my Vinland the Good.
   (violet claps her hand over john’s mouth.)
Or if I was the
Admiral, bossing a bothersome crew
and pretending a good deal of conﬁdence,
when suddenly there was a hint of glory!
I didn’t believe it, just because the
seaweed looked like fresh grass; I knew
I might be feverish and I didn’t want to
be taken in, but there was something in the
air—a sweetness like ﬁnding a ruby when
you were looking for a baseball—and at
the same time I was scared at not knowing,
it was mine and I hadn’t planned for it,
I wasn’t strong enough, and anyone could
knock me down, all those others who wanted
everything as much as I did.

     john:
Do I wake or sleep?

     violet:
I don’t know.
I’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s
been away all along. And still am.

     jack:
So I spent most of my time

                                                47
     wondering when bullets, mortars, and
     bombs were going to ﬁnd out where
     my courage ended and this cowardice—
     oh intuition, I’m not on trial am I?—
     began. Finally a sniper in a tree
     on the edge of the Paciﬁc’s
     exciting waters—an oriental with
     lots of time for meditation—
     saw me clearly. At the right moment.
     It was time, you see, not
     topographical like Achilles’ heel.
     I was thinking of myself as heir
     to the Mississippi. My thoughts moved
     to De Soto—whose wouldn’t? And
     that was when I was spotted, naked
     as the beach, caught within a few feet
     of safety. Have you ever thought
     about men like him—who could
     have been emperors? I fell like a
     sail, relaxed, with no surprise.
     And here I am.

         violet:
     By default, you mean.

         john:
     Pardon me, I’ve got to take a terriﬁc shit.

           violet:
     You may as well put your pants on
     before you come back.
       ( john goes rear and dresses.)

         jack:
     Oh Violet!

      violet:
Now don’t say anything you don’t mean.
Just go on with the news bulletin. We’re all
terribly interested in the outside world here.

     jack:
Well, if that’s the way you feel. Who is
that anyway?

     violet:
A jazz musician named Lenny.

     jack:
He’s billed as John under the buzzer in the hall.
Or is that another one?

     violet:
He’s the boarder.

     jack:
The boarder?

    violet:
A boarder. You’re looking handsome.

     jack:
Bunny!
  (They kiss fondly.)
What’s he doing? Who is he?
  (She pulls away, withdrawing from him.)

     violet:
Children wade on the receding shingle

     pogo sticks in the advancing foam.
     Where well-mannered aeroplanes and autos
     serenely sail, on the yellow sand, children
     ignore their own innocence. They’ve taken it all
     in, and know how they want their backs broken.
        (Then she faces him bitterly.)

          jack:
     I know all about the attractive distances and
     the distraction that’s more elegant than a knife.

           violet:
     Never mind the rabbits and tears. You’re
     just as ruthless as anyone else.

          jack:
     I thought
     I’d want to play cards all night when I got home.
     Listen, I know I’m stupid, I think for weeks
     about things other people read in the newspaper.

         violet:
     You may be dumb, but it makes you clever
     because you know it.

          jack:
     But I’ve been away.

           violet:
     All those letters, so beautiful . . .

     that’s all, I’ve just been away.

Fortunately I’ve always had a very strong sense
of responsibility for the happiness of others.

     jack:
You’re still in it.

     violet:
I’m a veritable Florence
Nightingale of the heart, or as one of your old friends
once remarked, “She has a bit of the good-hearted madam
in her.” You see, you haven’t asked me the right
questions.

me if my slip ﬁts?

          john:
     Well, has my little Cio-Cio San told
     the nasty Naval ofﬁcer to scram?

           jack:
     I’d like to have a word with you.

           john:
     Let’s have lunch together after you’ve found
     yourself a job. I’m writing a novel your ﬁrm
     may ﬁnd itself interested in.
       (violet turns to john.)

           violet:
     I wish you’d
     go away and stay away. All you’ve done is kept me
     looking out windows, wondering what things were
     really like. Get out!
     (But she throws herself into john’s arms and cries.)

          john:
     There, there.
        (He looks over her head at jack.)
     What have you done to my poor baby to confuse her?
     Why didn’t you send us a telegram to expect you?
     It was quite a shock to see you. I never saw you before,
     so you can imagine how it’s tested my equanimity.

          jack:
     Shock! I come home to ﬁnd you both in your
     underwear in this place that looks like the
     landscape outside a bottle factory, and you ask

     been eating my brain for years in the salt mines

of the heart, its panic? That’s where all the wars
rage, you know. That’s where all the despatches
come from. It’s never a matter of killing, it’s
a matter of suffering, it starts blowing up.
I want her, that’s all, I want her breasts
leaning into my armpit against shop windows on
Sundays, I want the empty smell of her ﬂesh
in the morning when she’s gotten up to go to
the bathroom, I want her whole open valley
breathing noisily when we’re drunk in the wet
mist of dawn as the pennants begin to stripe
themselves and the wind whines towards the
suburbs. You can’t have her.

     john:
You’re wrong.
She wants me, because she’s interested enough
to hurt me. Life went to the trouble of putting
me here in these old but well-worn clothes
that’ve seen better days and better hers
and never even wanted to go away and get ﬁxed up.
You’ve got a claim on it, but I’ve got it.
These things don’t happen temporarily.

      violet:
I love you.
   (Against his neck.)

      jack:
What did I do wrong? What’s happened to me? It’s
like coming onto the stage, sitting down at the piano,
and ﬁnding no orchestra there! Why feel guilty, if
what I’ve done doesn’t mean anything, if what I’ve said
doesn’t move you? I held you in my heart, like a charm—

     john:
I suppose I’m the snake-in-the-grass but
I can’t say I’m sorry. Someone has to smile

                                                          53
     at her as she comes back from the bathroom.
     Do you think everything can stay the same,
     like a photograph? What for?
        (jack starts to exit slowly.)

           violet:
     I would like to ﬁll a jungle
     with elephants and gorillas and
     boa constrictors. I would like
     to ﬁll the trees and waterfalls
     with the blackness in me, so I
     might be a bird of paradise.

     It would be fun to break a bottle
     of wine and have it turn to water.
     Or shoot a clay pigeon and have it
     go honk! honk! and lay an egg in
     the marshes. I’d rather not be
     a wedding guest.

     If I were the sphinx I could lie
     in the sun and stare at myself
     with pure white eyes. When I smiled
     airplanes would go off their courses.
     I’d hold down the dark and say
     sweet nothings to the palms.
        (He takes her in his arms.)

         john:
     Honey, I designed that costume for you.
     You always look that way to me.
     That’s why I’m so mean.

Quick! a last poem before I go
off my rocker. Oh Rachmaninoff !
Onset, Massachusetts. Is it the ﬁg-newton
playing the horn? Thundering windows
of hell, will your tubes ever break
into powder? Oh my palace of oranges,
junk shop, staples, umber, basalt;
I’m a child again when I was really
miserable, a grope pizzicato. My pocket
of rhinestone, yoyo, carpenter’s pencil,
amethyst, hypo, campaign button,
is the room full of smoke? Shit
on the soup, let it burn. So it’s back.
You’ll never be mentally sober.

          the hunter


He set out and kept hunting
and hunting. Where, he thought
and thought, is the real chamois?
and can I kill it where it is?
He had brought with him only a dish
of pears. The autumn wind soared
above the trails where the drops
of the chamois led him further.
The leaves dropped around him
like pie-plates. The stars fell
one by one into his eyes and burnt.

There is a geography which holds
its hands just so far from the breast
and pushes you away, crying so.
He went on to strange hills where
the stones were still warm from feet,
and then on and on. There were clouds
at his knees, his eyelashes
had grown thick from the colds,
as the fur of the bear does
in winter. Perhaps, he thought, I am
asleep, but he did not freeze to death.

There were little green needles
everywhere. And then manna fell.
He knew, above all, that he was now
approved, and his strength increased.
He saw the world below him, brilliant
as a ﬂoor, and steaming with gold,
with distance. There were occasionally
rifts in the cloud where the face
of a woman appeared, frowning. He




                                          57
     had gone higher. He wore ermine.
     He thought, why did I come? and then,
     I have come to rule! The chamois came.

     The chamois found him and they came
     in droves to humiliate him. Alone,
     in the clouds, he was humiliated.

The wheels are inside me thundering.
They do not churn me, they are inside.
They were not oiled, they burn
with friction and out of my eyes
comes smoke. Then the enormous bullets
streak towards me with their black tracers
and bury themselves deep in my muscles.
They won’t be taken out, I can still
move. Now I am going to lie down
like an expanse of marble ﬂoor
covered with commuters and information:
it is my vocation, you believe that,
don’t you? I don’t have an American
body, I have an anonymous body, though
you can get to love it, if you love
the corpses of the Renaissance; I am
reconstructed from a model of poetry,
you see, and this might be a horseless
carriage, it might be but it is not,
it is riddled with bullets, am I.
And if they are not thundering into me
they are thundering across me, on
the way to some devastated island
where they will eat wafﬂes with the
other Americans of American persuasion.
On rainy days I ache as if a train
were about to arrive, I switch my tracks.

During the noon-hour rush a friend
of mine took a letter carrier across
the catwalk underneath the dome
behind the enormous (wheels! wheels!)
windows which are the roof of the sun
and knelt inside my cathedral, mine
through pain! and the thundering went on.
He unzipped the messenger’s trousers
and relieved him of his missile, hands

                                             59
     on the messenger’s dirty buttocks,
     the smoking muzzle in his soft blue mouth.
     That is one way of dominating the terminal,
     but I have not done that. It will be
     my blood, I think, that dominates the trains.

So we are taking off our masks, are we, and keeping
our mouths shut? as if we’d been pierced by a glance!

The song of an old cow is not more full of judgment
than the vapors which escape one’s soul when one is sick;

so I pull the shadows around me like a puff
and crinkle my eyes as if at the most exquisite moment

of a very long opera, and then we are off !
without reproach and without hope that our delicate feet

will touch the earth again, let alone “very soon.”
It is the law of my own voice I shall investigate.

I start like ice, my ﬁnger to my ear, my ear
to my heart, that proud cur at the garbage can

in the rain. It’s wonderful to admire oneself
with complete candor, tallying up the merits of each

of the latrines. 14th Street is drunken and credulous,
53rd tries to tremble but is too at rest. The good

love a park and the inept a railway station,
and there are the divine ones who drag themselves up

and down the lengthening shadow of an Abyssinian head
in the dust, trailing their long elegant heels of hot air

crying to confuse the brave “It’s a summer day,
and I want to be wanted more than anything else in the world.”

     distinction.
                   So you do not like
     my new verses, written in the
     pages of Russian novels while I do
     not brood over an orderly
     childhood?
                   You are angry
     because I see the white-haired
     genius of the painter more beautiful
     than the stammering vivacity

     your temperament. And yes,
     it becomes more and more a matter
     of black and white between us

     and when the doctor comes to
     me he says “No things but in ideas”
     or it is overheard

            And of course we are weeping larks
falling all over the heavens with our shoulders clasped
in someone’s armpits, so tightly! and our throats are full.
      Haven’t you ever fallen down at Christmas
         and didn’t it move everyone who saw you?
             isn’t that what the tree means? the pure pleasure
   of making weep those whom you cannot move by your ﬂights!
             It’s enough to drive one to suicide.
   And the rooftops are falling apart like the applause

of rough, long-nailed, intimate, roughened-by-kisses, hands.
Fingers more breathless than a tongue laid upon the lips
in the hour of sunlight, early morning, before the mist rolls
in from the sea; and out there everything is turbulent and green.

     seen it

          instead of the Picasso no-penis shep­
     herd and its inﬂuence—for presence is
     better than absence, if you love excess.

         Oh now it is that all this music tumbles
     round me which was once considered muddy

          and today surrounds this ambiguity of
     our tables and our typewriter paper, more
     nostalgic than a disease,

          soft as one’s character, melancholy as
     one’s attractiveness,

            offering the pernicious advice of dreams.
     Is it too late for this?

          I am what people make of me—if they
     can and when they will. My difﬁculty is
     readily played—like a rhapsody, or a fresh

         epigram for joe


Here is the edge of the water where
the delicate crabs drift like shells;
stick in your purple toe “I’ve been swimming
for hours, it’s freezing!” and is it,
with all the salt falling like
a fountain across your mottled ﬂesh,
each curling hair unguently draped by
the shivering sun, pushed by short breezes
into a molding for your hot heart, a wire
basket. And where the sands sting you
they gleam like matchsticks in the noon.
You are standing in the doorway on the
green threshhold while it licks feet
that are burning to spread and ﬂutter.

                      meditations in an emergency


Am I to become proﬂigate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?

    Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the
same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be
nothing left with which to venture forth.

     Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?

     I am the least difﬁcult of men. All I want is boundless love.

     Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just
like a pile of leaves.

     However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nos­
talgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the
conﬁnes of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of
grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that
people do not totally regret life. It is more important to afﬁrm the least sincere; the
clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what
they’re missing? Uh huh.

    My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscrimi­
nate but ﬂeeting, entirely speciﬁc and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always
looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and
that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black,
brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I’m curious.
On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as
the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can
spare myself little sleep.

     Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you
are inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)

    St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in
Dostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you
in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the
ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a

66
hyacinth, “to keep the ﬁlth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the ﬁlth is
pumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may
become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.

    Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!

    It is easy to be beautiful; it is difﬁcult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the
trap you’ve set. It’s like a ﬁnal chapter no one reads because the plot is over.

      “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that
little Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too.
—Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whip­
ping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.

     I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be
back, I’ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go,
so I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t
be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.


                                                                                       1954

     to the mountains in new york


      Yes! yes! yes! I’ve decided,
      I’m letting my ﬂock run around,
      I’m dropping my pastoral pretensions!
      and leaves don’t fall into a little halo
      on my tanned and worried head.
      Let the houses ﬁll up with dirt.
      My master died in my heart.
      On the molten streets of New York
      the master put up signs of my death.
      I love this hairy city.
      It’s wrinkled like a detective story
      and noisy and getting fat and smudged
      lids hood the sharp hard black eyes.
      America’s wandering away from me
      in a dream of pine trees and clouds
      of pubic dreams of the world at my feet.
      The moon comes out: languorous
      in spite of everything, towards all
      its expectancy rides a slow white horse.
      I walk watching, tripping, alleys
      open and fall around me like footsteps
      of a newly shod horse treading the
      marble staircases of the palace
      and the light screams of the nobility
      oblige invisible bayonets. All
      night I sit on the outspread knees
      of addicts; their kindness
      makes them talk like whores to
      the sun as it moves me hysterically
      forward. The subway shoots onto a ramp
      overlooking the East River, the towers!
      the minarets! The bridge. I’m lost.

There’s no way back to the houses
ﬁlled with dirt. My master died
in my heart on the molten streets.

Everyone is drinking and falling
and the sour smiles of the wheels
and the curses of ambitious love.
I remember Moscow
I remember two herdsmen in fur caps
and they were lying down together
in the snow of their natural ferocity
which warded off the wolves.
But now no kisses reassure the animals
of my tent, and they wander drunkenly away
and I wander drunkenly here, clouded,
and I see no face to follow down the streets
through the gates of a great city
I was building to house the myth of my love.
I take a ﬂowery drop of gin upon my tongue
and it receives the ﬂaming sibilance
of the Volga. I am murmuring
past my own banks, rushing, ﬂoundering and black
at last, into the cleft of the ﬁlth.
My head is hot here in the snow and I dart
rebellious looks into the severely hidden
bootless snow. My own youth has narrowed
like a knife which cures the pleasures of life.

I shall never return! though I twist, come back,
grow pale, as the receding waves seem to lick the shore.
I cannot give myself now, I can only rush




                                                           69
     towards you, engulf you, and pour forth!
     The moon is desirous of detaining me, you,
     but you are gone, and I follow.

            3
     I feel the earth pulsing against my heart.
     They call me The Dirt Eater. The Gambler.
     I can’t rise, I’m so ﬁlthy! so heavy!
     at last I have my full stench, I’ve rediscovered
     you. That’s why you went away, isn’t it?
     I could have stayed forever in your arms.
     But then I’d have become you. Now I’ve become the earth!
     You died, and the tempestuous blue of my eyes
     ﬁlled the sails of your funeral barque
     which, I remember, was ﬁlled with walnuts.
     It is raining. Shall I grow trees or ﬂowers?

My heart’s aﬂutter!
I am standing in the bath tub
crying. Mother, mother
who am I? If he
will just come back once
and kiss me on the face
his coarse hair brush
my temple, it’s throbbing!

then I can put on my clothes
I guess, and walk the streets.

      2
I love you. I love you,
but I’m turning to my verses
and my heart is closing
like a ﬁst.

Words! be
sick as I am sick, swoon,
roll back your eyes, a pool,

and I’ll stare down
at my wounded beauty
which at best is only a talent
for poetry.

Cannot please, cannot charm or win
what a poet!
and the clear water is thick

     I embraced a cloud,
     but when I soared
     it rained.

           3
     That’s funny! there’s blood on my chest
     oh yes, I’ve been carrying bricks
     what a funny place to rupture!
     and now it is raining on the ailanthus
     as I step out onto the window ledge
     the tracks below me are smoky and
     glistening with a passion for running
     I leap into the leaves, green like the sea

          4
     Now I am quietly waiting for
     the catastrophe of my personality
     to seem beautiful again,
     and interesting, and modern.

     The country is grey and
     brown and white in trees,
     snows and skies of laughter
     always diminishing, less funny
     not just darker, not just grey.

     It may be the coldest day of
     the year, what does he think of
     that? I mean, what do I? And if I do,
     perhaps I am myself again.

                      in the movies


Out of the corner of my eyes
a tear of revulsion sighs,
it’s the point of intersection a foot in front of me,
I call it my cornea, my Muse.
I hurl myself there—at whatever fatal ﬂowery ﬂourish!
ﬂower? ﬂower?
if that face is ﬂourishing, it’s toes of tin!
Well, but there is a face there, a ravine of powder and gasps,
I can see it, I must caress it.
I give it one of my marine caresses since it is inferior, petulant.
And the clear water of my head pours over that face.

Flowers. Flowers.
Just because the day is as long and white as a camel
you’ll see my head leaning against this masseur of a seat
and the blood in my pants mounts to the stars
as I ponder the silver square.

Flowers. Flowers,
every afternoon at one, why not caress the wind
which passes from the air conditioning to my seat?
as the waters underneath Times Square
pour through my eyes onto the silver screen.
I’m here, pale and supple as a horse-shrine.

Ushers! ushers!
do you seek me with your lithe ﬂashlights?
enveloping me like the controlled current of the air?
There seems to be a ghost up there,
brushing off his gems and plumes.
It’s a great feathery candle glowing in the rain
of my ﬁne retrieving gaze,
the large feathered prick that impaled me in the grass.
It was an organ that announced a certain destiny.
And as the plumes ﬂutter in the current they spell out *****



                                                                      73
     but I don’t believe my eyes, it’s only a ghost’s habit.
     I bought a ticket so I could be alone. With the plumes.
     With the ushers.
     With my own prick,
     and with my death written in smoke
     outside this theatre where I receive my mail.
     Guts? my gut is full of water, like the River Jordan.

     The pressure of my boredom is uplifting and cool,
     I feel its familiar hands on my buttocks.
     And we depend on the screen for accompaniment,
     its mirrors
     its music
     because I’ve left everything behind but a leaf
     and now a dark hand lifts that from my thighs
     (out of the corner of my eyes
     a tear of revulsion sighs).
     No, I’ve never been in a cotton ﬁeld in South Carolina.
     My head is lost between your purple lips.
     Your teeth glitter like the Aurora Borealis.

     Cerise trees are plunging through my veins
     and not one lumberjack is drowned in my giant ﬂesh.
     This stranger collects me like a sea-story
     and now I am part of his marine slang.
     Waves break in the theatre
     and ﬂame ﬁnds a passage through the stormy straits of my lips.

     In my hands a black cloud of soft winds
     pulses forth the error of my blood and my body,
     like a poem written in blackface,
     his ﬂower opens and I press my face into the dahlialike mirror
     whose lips press mine with the grandeur of a torrent,
     it is ﬂooding the cleft of my rocklike face
     which burns with the anguish of a plaster beast!
     I am said to have the eyes of a camelopard
     and the lips of an oriole,

74
it’s my movie reputation—
so now you’ve found my germinal spontaneity
and you are my voyage to Africa.

I love your naked storms.
I contemplate you with the profound regard of a scriptwriter.
The serene horse of your forgetfulness is a crater
in which I bathe the pride of my race,
as we splash away the afternoon
in the movies
and in the mountains.

Reﬂect a moment on the ﬂesh in which you’re mired:
I’m the white heron of your darkness,
I’m the ghost of a tribal chief killed in battle
and I bear proudly the slit nose of your victories.

Suffer my cornea to adopt a verbal blueness,
for you are the sick prince of my cerise innovations,
and my seriousness.
I bear you mirrors
and I kiss the sill of your porcelain fountain,
dreaming midst the ﬂamingo plumes of your penis.

Seized by ﬂames!
seized by winds!
sea of my sex and your red domination!
(red is for my heart and for the wind of my islands)
which envelops this insect, my self,
and salutes your loins
as the shadowy horses increase
and I pale with butterﬂy aspirations.

Do you feel the hairs that ﬁll my mouth like aigrettes,
as moss ﬁlls the stone with longing no hands can tear away?
do you feel your sword imbedded in the legendary rock?
the repose of rivers,

                                                                75
     the source of warriors,
     warriors of the stars which are my sighs
     and my sighs are black
     because my blood is black with your love,
     the love of the jungle for its secret pools.

     We take the silver way along the rocks
     and with my head upon your chocolate breast
     the screen is again a horizon of blood.
     The drapes ﬂutter around us like cement.
     In your drowning caresses I walk the sea.
     I am gilded with your sweat
     and your hair smells of herbs
     from which I do not care to peer.

     If love is born from this projection in the golden beehive like a swan,
     I love you.
     I am lighting up the evening which is yours,
     I implore you;
     and the smoke of my death will have blown away by now,
     as my ghosts are laid along your glittering teeth.


                                                                       1954

       If I rest for a moment near The Equestrian
pausing for a liver sausage sandwich in the Mayﬂower Shoppe,
that angel seems to be leading the horse into Bergdorf ’s
and I am naked as a table cloth, my nerves humming.
Close to the fear of war and the stars which have disappeared.
I have in my hands only 35¢, it’s so meaningless to eat!
and gusts of water spray over the basins of leaves
like the hammers of a glass pianoforte. If I seem to you
to have lavender lips under the leaves of the world,
       I must tighten my belt.
It’s like a locomotive on the march, the season
       of distress and clarity
and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter’s
lightly falling snow over the newspapers.
Clasp me in your handkerchief like a tear, trumpet
of early afternoon! in the foggy autumn.
As they’re putting up the Christmas trees on Park Avenue
I shall see my daydreams walking by with dogs in blankets,
put to some use before all those coloured lights come on!
       But no more fountains and no more rain,
       and the stores stay open terribly late.

     You can be Tu Fu, I’ll be Po Chü-i
     and the Monkey Lady’ll be in the moon,
     smiling at our ill-ﬁtting heads
     as we watch snow settle on a twig.
     Or shall we be really gone? this

    for grace, after a party


       You do not always know what I am feeling.
Last night in the warm spring air while I was
blazing my tirade against someone who doesn’t
interest
         me, it was love for you that set me
aﬁre,
       and isn’t it odd? for in rooms full of
strangers my most tender feelings
                                      writhe and
bear the fruit of screaming. Put out your hand,
isn’t there
            an ashtray, suddenly, there? beside
the bed? And someone you love enters the room
and says wouldn’t
                      you like the eggs a little
different today?
                    And when they arrive they are
just plain scrambled eggs and the warm weather
is holding.

     I watched an armory combing its bronze bricks
     and in the sky there were glistening rails of milk.
     Where had the swan gone, the one with the lame back?

                     Now mounting the steps
                     I enter my new home full
                     of grey radiators and glass
                     ashtrays full of wool.

     Against the winter I must get a samovar
     embroidered with basil leaves and Ukranian mottos
     to the distant sound of wings, painfully anti-wind,

                     a little bit of the blue
                     summer air will come back
                     as the steam chuckles in
                     the monster’s steamy attack

     and I’ll be happy here and happy there, full
     of tea and tears. I don’t suppose I’ll ever get
     to Italy, but I have the terrible tundra at least.

                     My new home will be full
                     of wood, roots and the like,
                     while I pace in a turtleneck
                     sweater, repairing my bike.

     I watched the palisades shivering in the snow
     of my face, which had grown preternaturally pure.
     Once I destroyed a man’s idea of himself to have him.

                     If I’d had a samovar then
                     I’d have made him tea
                     and as hyacinths grow from
                     a pot he would love me



80
and my charming room of tea cosies full of dirt
which is why I must travel, to collect the leaves.
O my enormous piano, you are not like being outdoors

               though it is cold and you
               are made of ﬁre and wood!
               I lift your lid and mountains
               return, that I am good.

The stars blink like a hairnet that was dropped
on a seat and now it is lying in the alley behind
the theater where my play is echoed by dying voices.

               I am really a woodcarver
               and my words are love
               which willfully parades in
               its room, refusing to move.

                                    to James Schuyler

     There I could never be a boy,
     though I rode like a god when the horse reared.
     At a cry from mother I fell to my knees!
     there I fell, clumsy and sick and good,
     though I bloomed on the back of a frightened black mare
     who had leaped windily at the start of a leaf
     and she never threw me.

     I had a quick heart
     and my thighs clutched her back.
     I loved her fright, which was against me
     into the air! and the diamond white of her forelock
     which seemed to smart with thoughts as my heart smarted with life!
     and she’d toss her head with the pain
     and paw the air and champ the bit, as if I were Endymion
     and she, moonlike, hated to love me.

     All things are tragic
     when a mother watches!
     and she wishes upon herself
     the random fears of a scarlet soul, as it breathes in and out
     and nothing chokes, or breaks from triumph to triumph!

     I knew her but I could not be a boy,
     for in the billowing air I was ﬂeet and green
     riding blackly through the ethereal night
     towards men’s words which I gracefully understood,

     and it was given to me
     as the soul is given the hands
     to hold the ribbons of life!
     as miles streak by beneath the moon’s sharp hooves
     and I have mastered the speed and strength which is the armor of the world.


                                                                           1954

I wanted to be sure to reach you;
though my ship was on the way it got caught
in some moorings. I am always tying up
and then deciding to depart. In storms and
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide
around my fathomless arms, I am unable
to understand the forms of my vanity
or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder
in my hand and the sun sinking. To
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage
of my will. The terrible channels where
the wind drives me against the brown lips
of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet
I trust the sanity of my vessel; and
if it sinks, it may well be in answer
to the reasoning of the eternal voices,
the waves which have kept me from reaching you.

     My back is peeling and the tar
     melts underfoot as I cross the street.
     Sweaty foreheads wipe on my shirt
     as I pass. The sun hits a building
     and shines off onto my face. The sun
     licks my feet through my moccasins
     as I feel my way along the asphalt.
     The sun beams on my buttocks
     as I outdistance the crowd. For a
     moment I enter the cavernous vault
     and its deadish cold. I suck off
     every man in the Manhattan Storage &
     Warehouse Co. Then, refreshed, again
     to the streets! to the generous sun
     and the vigorous heat of the city.

Joe is restless and so am I, so restless.
Button’s buddy lips frame “L G T TH O P?”
across the bar. “Yes!” I cry, for dancing’s
my soul delight. (Feet! feet!) “Come on!”

Through the streets we skip like swallows.
Howard malingers. (Come on, Howard.) Ashes
malingers. (Come on, J.A.) Dick malingers.
(Come on, Dick.) Alvin darts ahead. (Wait up,
Alvin.) Jack, Earl and Someone don’t come.

Down the dark stairs drifts the steaming cha­
cha-cha. Through the urine and smoke we charge
to the ﬂoor. Wrapped in Ashes’ arms I glide.
(It’s heaven!) Button lindys with me. (It’s
heaven!) Joe’s two-steps, too, are incredible,
and then a fast rhumba with Alvin, like skipping
on toothpicks. And the interminable intermissions,

we have them. Jack, Earl and Someone drift
guiltily in. “I knew they were gay
the minute I laid eyes on them!” screams John.
How ashamed they are of us! we hope.

     There’s nothing worse
     than feeling bad and not
     being able to tell you.
     Not because you’d kill me
     or it would kill you, or
     we don’t love each other.
     It’s space. The sky is grey
     and clear, with pink and
     blue shadows under each cloud.
     A tiny airliner drops its
     specks over the U N Building.
     My eyes, like millions of
     glassy squares, merely reﬂect.
     Everything sees through me,
     in the daytime I’m too hot
     and at night I freeze; I’m
     built the wrong way for the
     river and a mild gale would
     break every ﬁber in me.
     Why don’t I go east and west
     instead of north and south?
     It’s the architect’s fault.
     And in a few years I’ll be
     useless, not even an ofﬁce
     building. Because you have
     no telephone, and live so
     far away; the Pepsi-Cola sign,
     the seagulls and the noise.

Johnny and Alvin are going home, are sleeping now
are fanning the air with breaths from the same bed.

The moon is covered with gauze and the laughs
are not in them. The boats honk and the barges heave

a little, so the river is moved by a faint breeze.
Where are the buses that would take them to another state?

standing on corners; a nurse waits with a purse
and a murderer escapes the detectives by taking a public

conveyance through the summer’s green reﬂections.
There’s too much lime in the world and not enough gin,

they gasp. The gentle are curious, but the curious
are not gentle. So the breaths come home and sleep.

     comes not, except a sea urchin’s dropped and cracked

     on the rocks and falling bird eats him to rise
     more strongly into fog or luminous purple wind. So
     to be used and rest, the spiny thing is empty, still
     increasing decoration on the craggy slopes above

     the barnacles. Lightly falls the grieving light
     over the heel of Great Spruce Head Island, like cool
     words turning their back on the bayness of the bay
     and open water where the swell says heavy things

     and smoothly to the nonreﬂective caves. Clover lies,
     in its mauve decline, to the butterﬂies and bumblebees
     and hummingbirds and hornets ﬁnding not their sucking
     appetites attractive in its stirring dryness, robbed

     out of succulence into fainting, rattling noise. Only
     the child loves noise, your head is clear as a rock
     in air above the ﬁsh hawk’s habitual shriek at menace
     already moving away, above the ﬁsh which will not leave the weir

     once there as the tide has pulled them. The holy land
     outside of nature nothing feeds, as rocks address no sun.


                                                                 1955

                  thinking of james dean


Like a nickelodeon soaring over the island from sea to bay,
two pots of gold, and the ﬂushed effulgence of a sky Tiepolo
and Turner had compiled in vistavision. Each panoramic second, of
his death. The rainbows canceling each other out, between martinis

and the steak. To bed to dream, the moon invisibly scudding
under black-blue clouds, a stern Puritanical breeze pushing at
the house, to dream of roaches nibbling at my racing toenails,
great-necked speckled geese and slapping their proud heads

as I ran past. Morning. The ﬁrst plunge in dolorous surf
and the brilliant sunlight declaring all the qualities of the world.
Like an ant, dragging its sorrows up and down the sand to ﬁnd
a hiding place never, here where everything is guarded by dunes

or drifting. The sea is dark and smells of ﬁsh beneath its
silver surface. To reach the depths and rise, only in the sea;
the abysses of life, incessantly plunging not to rise to a face
of heat and joy again; habits of total immersion and the stance

victorious in death. And after hours of lying in nature, to nature,
and simulated death in the crushing waves, their shells and heart
pounding me naked on the shingle: had I died at twenty-four as he, but
in Boston, robbed of these suns and knowledges, a corpse more whole,

less deeply torn, less bruised and less alive, perhaps backstage
at the Brattle Theatre amidst the cold cream and the familiar lice
in my red-gold costume for a bit in Julius Caesar, would I be
smaller now in the vastness of light? a cork in the monumental

stillness of an eye-green trough, a sliver on the bleaching beach
to airplanes carried by the panting clouds to Spain. My friends
are roaming or listening to La Bohème. Precisely, the cold last swim
before the city ﬂatters meanings of my life I cannot ﬁnd,




                                                                         89
     squeezing me like an orange for some nebulous vitality, mourning
     to the fruit ignorant of science in its hasty dying, kissing
     its leaves and stem, exuding oils of Florida in the ﬁnal glass of
     pleasure. A leaving word in the sand, odor of tides: his name.


                                                                 1955

               my heart


I’m not going to cry all the time
nor shall I laugh all the time,
I don’t prefer one “strain” to another.
I’d have the immediacy of a bad movie,
not just a sleeper, but also the big,
overproduced ﬁrst-run kind. I want to be
at least as alive as the vulgar. And if
some aﬁcionado of my mess says “That’s
not like Frank!,” all to the good! I
don’t wear brown and grey suits all the time,
do I? No. I wear workshirts to the opera,
often. I want my feet to be bare,
I want my face to be shaven, and my heart—
you can’t plan on the heart, but
the better part of it, my poetry, is open.

                    to the film industry in crisis


     Not you, lean quarterlies and swarthy periodicals
     with your studious incursions toward the pomposity of ants,
     nor you, experimental theatre in which Emotive Fruition
     is wedding Poetic Insight perpetually, nor you,
     promenading Grand Opera, obvious as an ear (though you
     are close to my heart), but you, Motion Picture Industry,
     it’s you I love!

     In times of crisis, we must all decide again and again whom we love.
     And give credit where it’s due: not to my starched nurse, who taught me
     how to be bad and not bad rather than good (and has lately availed
     herself of this information), not to the Catholic Church
     which is at best an oversolemn introduction to cosmic entertainment,
     not to the American Legion, which hates everybody, but to you,
     glorious Silver Screen, tragic Technicolor, amorous Cinemascope,
     stretching Vistavision and startling Stereophonic Sound, with all
     your heavenly dimensions and reverberations and iconoclasms! To
     Richard Barthelmess as the “tol’able” boy barefoot and in pants,
     Jeanette MacDonald of the ﬂaming hair and lips and long, long neck,
     Sue Carroll as she sits for eternity on the damaged fender of a car
     and smiles, Ginger Rogers with her pageboy bob like a sausage
     on her shufﬂing shoulders, peach-melba-voiced Fred Astaire of the feet,
     Eric von Stroheim, the seducer of mountain-climbers’ gasping spouses,
     the Tarzans, each and every one of you (I cannot bring myself to prefer
     Johnny Weissmuller to Lex Barker, I cannot!), Mae West in a furry sled,
     her bordello radiance and bland remarks, Rudolph Valentino of the moon,
     its crushing passions, and moonlike, too, the gentle Norma Shearer,
     Miriam Hopkins dropping her champagne glass off Joel McCrea’s yacht
     and crying into the dappled sea, Clark Gable rescuing Gene Tierney
     from Russia and Allan Jones rescuing Kitty Carlisle from Harpo Marx,
     Cornel Wilde coughing blood on the piano keys while Merle Oberon berates,
     Marilyn Monroe in her little spike heels reeling through Niagara Falls,
     Joseph Cotten puzzling and Orson Welles puzzled and Dolores del Rio
     eating orchids for lunch and breaking mirrors, Gloria Swanson reclining,
     and Jean Harlow reclining and wiggling, and Alice Faye reclining
     and wiggling and singing, Myrna Loy being calm and wise, William Powell
     in his stunning urbanity, Elizabeth Taylor blossoming, yes, to you

92
and to all you others, the great, the near-great, the featured, the extras
who pass quickly and return in dreams saying your one or two lines,
my love!
Long may you illumine space with your marvellous appearances, delays
and enunciations, and may the money of the world glitteringly cover you
as you rest after a long day under the kleig lights with your faces
in packs for our ediﬁcation, the way the clouds come often at night
but the heavens operate on the star system. It is a divine precedent
you perpetuate! Roll on, reels of celluloid, as the great earth rolls on!

           on seeing larry rivers’
     WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE
      at the museum of modern art


      Now that our hero has come back to us
      in his white pants and we know his nose
      trembling like a ﬂag under ﬁre,
      we see the calm cold river is supporting
      our forces, the beautiful history.

      To be more revolutionary than a nun
      is our desire, to be secular and intimate
      as, when sighting a redcoat, you smile
      and pull the trigger. Anxieties
      and animosities, ﬂaming and feeding

      on theoretical considerations and
      the jealous spiritualities of the abstract,
      the robot? they’re smoke, billows above
      the physical event. They have burned up.
      See how free we are! as a nation of persons.

      Dear father of our country, so alive
      you must have lied incessantly to be
      immediate, here are your bones crossed
      on my breast like a rusty ﬂintlock,
      a pirate’s ﬂag, bravely speciﬁc

      and ever so light in the misty glare
      of a crossing by water in winter to a shore
      other than that the bridge reaches for.
      Don’t shoot until, the white of freedom glinting
      on your gun barrel, you see the general fear.

Why do you play such dreary music

mortally tired I long for a little
reminder of immortal energy?

               sleeping on the wing


     Perhaps it is to avoid some great sadness,
     as in a Restoration tragedy the hero cries “Sleep!
     O for a long sound sleep and so forget it!”
     that one ﬂies, soaring above the shoreless city,
     veering upward from the pavement as a pigeon
     does when a car honks or a door slams, the door
     of dreams, life perpetuated in parti-colored loves
     and beautiful lies all in different languages.

     Fear drops away too, like the cement, and you
     are over the Atlantic. Where is Spain? where is
     who? The Civil War was fought to free the slaves,
     was it? A sudden down-draught reminds you of gravity
     and your position in respect to human love. But
     here is where the gods are, speculating, bemused.
     Once you are helpless, you are free, can you believe
     that? Never to waken to the sad struggle of a face?
     to travel always over some impersonal vastness,
     to be out of, forever, neither in nor for!

     The eyes roll asleep as if turned by the wind
     and the lids ﬂutter open slightly like a wing.
     The world is an iceberg, so much is invisible!
     and was and is, and yet the form, it may be sleeping
     too. Those features etched in the ice of someone
     loved who died, you are a sculptor dreaming of space
     and speed, your hand alone could have done this.
     Curiosity, the passionate hand of desire. Dead,
     or sleeping? Is there speed enough? And, swooping,
     you relinquish all that you have made your own,
     the kingdom of your self sailing, for you must awake
     and breathe your warmth in this beloved image
     whether it’s dead or merely disappearing,
     as space is disappearing and your singularity.

     It is 1:55 in Cambridge, pale and spring cool,
     it is. Evenings in Jim’s Place with Jimmy
     and listening to Lenya sing all day long. Yes,
     I would like another beer and Bert Brecht is
     a great poet, and Kurt Weill, he is a genius too.
     Most of all it is a gift from Wystan, Germany,
     when years ago Storm Troopers came close
     as a knock on our doors before we met, as
     terrifying as a game at recess when the bullies
     were on the other side. And when they were on
     our side it was worse. And gradually fearing
     disappeared in knowing, another gift from Wystan,
     though it too was worse, for there is no paying
     on both sides. And now it is almost the last hour
     of your visit, Jimmy, no more walks by the Charles
     “the alluvial river” drifting through a town
     that’s pretty because it is so ﬂat. No more
     great decisions on titles and places, no more
     too many drinks. Will those poems ever get
     written? will our royalties from VISITING
     ANGKOR VAT AND VIENNA really sustain us, in a
     future that only yesterday seemed so literally
     bright? Goodbye. At least we’ve written our ODE.
     And elsewhere, as snows dirty, we’ll sit
     for long long days and talk and play the phonograph
     and heat the coffee. And silent, go to a bar.

   And tomorrow morning at 8 o’clock in Springﬁeld, Massachusetts,
   my oldest aunt will be buried from a convent.
   Spring is here and I am staying here, I’m not going.
   Do birds ﬂy? I am thinking my own thoughts, who else’s?

         When I die, don’t come, I wouldn’t want a leaf
         to turn away from the sun—it loves it there.
         There’s nothing so spiritual about being happy
         but you can’t miss a day of it, because it doesn’t last.

   So this is the devil’s dance? Well I was born to dance.
   It’s a sacred duty, like being in love with an ape,
   and eventually I’ll reach some great conclusion, like assumption,
   when at last I meet exhaustion in these ﬂowers, go straight up.

      “Ah daddy, I wanna stay drunk many days”
      on the poetry of a new friend
      my life held precariously in the seeing

Coming down the ladder
you can hardly remember the plane was like a rabbit
                           the air above the clouds
                           that settling into the earth
               was like diving onto the sea on your belly,
there are so many similarities you have forgotten.

Well, there are a lot of things you haven’t forgotten,
walking through the waiting room you know you should go
to bed with everyone who looks at you because the war’s not over,
no assurance yet that desire’s an exaggeration
and you don’t want anyone to turn out to be a ruined city, do you?

As Marilyn Monroe says, it’s a responsibility being a sexual symbol,
and as everyone says, it’s the property of a symbol to be sexual.
Who’s confused? Dead citizen or survivor, it’s only your cock or your ass.
They do what they can in gardens and parks,
                             in subway stations and latrines,
as boyscouts rub sticks together who’ve read the manual,
                             know what’s expected of death.

                      in memory of my feelings
                                  to Grace Hartigan

            1
      My quietness has a man in it, he is transparent
      and he carries me quietly, like a gondola, through the streets.
      He has several likenesses, like stars and years, like numerals.
      My quietness has a number of naked selves,
      so many pistols I have borrowed to protect myselves
      from creatures who too readily recognize my weapons
      and have murder in their heart!
                                        though in winter
      they are warm as roses, in the desert
      taste of chilled anisette.
                                 At times, withdrawn,
      I rise into the cool skies
      and gaze on at the imponderable world with the simple identiﬁcation
      of my colleagues, the mountains. Manfred climbs to my nape,
      speaks, but I do not hear him,
                                       I’m too blue.
      An elephant takes up his trumpet,
      money ﬂutters from the windows of cries, silk stretching its mirror
      across shoulder blades. A gun is “ﬁred.”
                                                 One of me rushes
      to window #13 and one of me raises his whip and one of me
      ﬂutters up from the center of the track amidst the pink ﬂamingoes,
      and underneath their hooves as they round the last turn my lips
      are scarred and brown, brushed by tails, masked in dirt’s lust,
      deﬁnition, open mouths gasping for the cries of the bettors for the lungs
      of earth.
                 So many of my transparencies could not resist the race!
      Terror in earth, dried mushrooms, pink feathers, tickets,
      a ﬂaking moon drifting across the muddied teeth,
      the imperceptible moan of covered breathing,
                                                        love of the serpent!
      I am underneath its leaves as the hunter crackles and pants
      and bursts, as the barrage balloon drifts behind a cloud
      and animal death whips out its ﬂashlight,
                                                  whistling


102
and slipping the glove off the trigger hand. The serpent’s eyes
redden at sight of those thorny ﬁngernails, he is so smooth!
                                               My transparent selves
ﬂail about like vipers in a pail, writhing and hissing
without panic, with a certain justice of response
and presently the aquiline serpent comes to resemble the Medusa.

     2
The dead hunting
and the alive, ahunted.
                          My father, my uncle,
my grand-uncle and the several aunts. My
grand-aunt dying for me, like a talisman, in the war,
before I had even gone to Borneo
her blood vessels rushed to the surface
and burst like rockets over the wrinkled
invasion of the Australians, her eyes aslant
like the invaded, but blue like mine.
An atmosphere of supreme lucidity,
                                       humanism,
the mere existence of emphasis,
                                   a rusted barge
painted orange against the sea
full of Marines reciting the Arabian ideas
which are a proof in themselves of seasickness
which is a proof in itself of being hunted.
A hit? ergo swim.
                  My 10        my 19,
my 9,          and the several years. My
12 years since they all died, philosophically speaking.
And now the coolness of a mind
like a shuttered suite in the Grand Hotel
where mail arrives for my incognito,
                                        whose façade
has been slipping into the Grand Canal for centuries;
rockets splay over a sposalizio,


                                                                       103
                                     ﬂeeing into night
      from their Chinese memories, and it is a celebration,
      the trying desperately to count them as they die.
      But who will stay to be these numbers
      when all the lights are dead?

           3
      The most arid stretch is often richest,
      the hand lifting towards a ﬁg tree from hunger
                                                       digging
      and there is water, clear, supple, or there
      deep in the sand where death sleeps, a murmurous bubbling
      proclaims the blackness that will ease and burn.
      You preferred the Arabs? but they didn’t stay to count
      their inventions, racing into sands, converting themselves into
      so many,
                embracing, at Ramadan, the tenderest efﬁgies of
      themselves with penises shorn by the hundreds, like a camel
      ravishing a goat.
                         And the mountainous-minded Greeks could speak
      of time as a river and step across it into Persia, leaving the pain
      at home to be converted into statuary. I adore the Roman copies.
      And the stench of the camel’s spit I swallow,
      and the stench of the whole goat. For we have advanced, France,
      together into a new land, like the Greeks, where one feels nostalgic
      for mere ideas, where truth lies on its deathbed like an uncle
      and one of me has a sentimental longing for number,

      How many selves are there in a war hero asleep in names? under
      a blanket of platoon and ﬂeet, orderly. For every seaman
      with one eye closed in fear and twitching arm at a sigh for Lord Nelson,
      he is all dead; and now a meek subaltern writhes in his bedclothes

with the fury of a thousand, violating an insane mistress
who has only herself to offer his multitudes.
                                               Rising,
he wraps himself in the burnoose of memories against the heat of life
and over the sands he goes to take an algebraic position in re
a sun of fear shining not too bravely. He will ask himselves to
vote on fear before he feels a tremor,
                             as runners arrive from the mountains
bearing snow, proof that the mind’s obsolescence is still capable
of intimacy. His mistress will follow him across the desert
like a goat, towards a mirage which is something familiar about
one of his innumerable wrists,
                                 and lying in an oasis one day,
playing catch with coconuts, they suddenly smell oil.

tired of night, watched themselves in the water

my body, the naked host to my many selves, shot
by a guerrilla warrior or dumped from a car into ferns
which are themselves journalières.

and so remember it,
                       and I have lost what is always and everywhere
present, the scene of my selves, the occasion of these ruses,
which I myself and singly must now kill
                              and save the serpent in their midst.

 a step away from them


It’s my lunch hour, so I go
for a walk among the hum-colored
cabs. First, down the sidewalk
where laborers feed their dirty
glistening torsos sandwiches
and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets
on. They protect them from falling
bricks, I guess. Then onto the
avenue where skirts are ﬂipping
above heels and blow up over
grates. The sun is hot, but the
cabs stir up the air. I look
at bargains in wristwatches. There
are cats playing in sawdust.
                                   On
to Times Square, where the sign
blows smoke over my head, and higher
the waterfall pours lightly. A
Negro stands in a doorway with a
toothpick, languorously agitating.
A blonde chorus girl clicks: he
smiles and rubs his chin. Everything
suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of
a Thursday.
              Neon in daylight is a
great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would
write, as are light bulbs in daylight.
I stop for a cheeseburger at juliet’s
corner. Giulietta Masina, wife of
Federico Fellini, è bell’ attrice.
And chocolate malted. A lady in
foxes on such a day puts her poodle
in a cab.
          There are several Puerto
Ricans on the avenue today, which
makes it beautiful and warm. First
Bunny died, then John Latouche,

      then Jackson Pollock. But is the
      earth as full as life was full, of them?
      And one has eaten and one walks,
      past the magazines with nudes
      and the posters for bullfight and
      the Manhattan Storage Warehouse,
      which they’ll soon tear down. I
      used to think they had the Armory
      Show there.
                     A glass of papaya juice
      and back to work. My heart is in my
      pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.

  I am ill today but I am not
  too ill. I am not ill at all.
  It is a perfect day, warm
  for winter, cold for fall.

  A ﬁne day for seeing. I see
  ceramics, during lunch hour, by
  Miró, and I see the sea by Léger;
  light, complicated Metzingers
  and a rude awakening by Brauner,
  a little table by Picasso, pink.

  I am tired today but I am not
  too tired. I am not tired at all.
  There is the Pollock, white, harm
  will not fall, his perfect hand

  and the many short voyages. They’ll
  never fence the silver range.
  Stars are out and there is sea
  enough beneath the glistening earth
  to bear me toward the future
  which is not so dark. I see.

why i am not a painter


I am not a painter, I am a poet.
Why? I think I would rather be
a painter, but I am not. Well,

for instance, Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting. I drop in.
“Sit down and have a drink” he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. “You have sardines in it.”
“Yes, it needed something there.”
“Oh.” I go and the days go by
and I drop in again. The painting
is going on, and I go, and the days
go by. I drop in. The painting is
ﬁnished. “Where’s sardines?”
All that’s left is just
letters, “It was too much,” Mike says.

But me? One day I am thinking of
a color: orange. I write a line
about orange. Pretty soon it is a
whole page of words, not lines.
Then another page. There should be
so much more, not of orange, of
words, of how terrible orange is
and life. Days go by. It is even in
prose, I am a real poet. My poem
is ﬁnished and I haven’t mentioned
orange yet. It’s twelve poems, I call
it oranges. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike’s painting, called sardines.

                      poem read at joan mitchell’s


At last you are tired of being single
the effort to be new does not upset you nor the effort to be other
you are not tired of life together

city noises are louder because you are together
being together you arc louder than calling separately across a telephone one to the other
and there is no noise like the rare silence when you both sleep
even country noises—a dog bays at the moon, but when it loves the
           moon it bows, and the hitherto frowning moon fawns and slips

Only you in New York are not boring tonight
it is most modern to afﬁrm some one
(we don’t really love ideas, do we?)
and Joan was surprising you with a party for which I was the decoy
but you were surprising us by getting married and going away
so I am here reading poetry anyway
and no one will be bored tonight by me because you’re here

Yesterday I felt very tired from being at the five spot
and today I felt very tired from going to bed early and reading ulysses
but tonight I feel energetic because I’m sort of the bugle,
like waking people up, of your peculiar desire to get married

It’s so
original, hydrogenic, anthropomorphic, ﬁscal, post-anti-esthetic,
           bland, unpicturesque and WilliamCarlosWilliamsian!
it’s deﬁnitely not 19th Century, it’s not even Partisan Review, it’s
           new, it must be vanguard!

Tonight you probably walked over here from Bethune Street
down Greenwich Avenue with its sneaky little bars and the Women’s Detention House,
across 8th Street, by the acres of books and pillows and shoes and
          illuminating lampshades,
past Cooper Union where we heard the piece by Mortie Feldman with “The
          Stars and Stripes Forever” in it
and the Sagamore’s terriﬁc “coffee and, Andy,” meaning “with a cheese
          Danish”—

   114
did you spit on your index ﬁngers and rub the cedar’s neon circle for
          luck?
did you give a kind thought, hurrying, to Alger Hiss?

It’s the day before February 17th
it is not snowing yet but it is dark and may snow yet
dreary February of the exhaustion from parties and the exceptional de­
            sire for spring which the ballet alone, by extending its run,
            has made bearable, dear New York City Ballet company, you are
            quite a bit like a wedding yourself !
and the only signs of spring are Maria Tallchief ’s rhinestones and a
            perky little dog barking in a bar, here and there eyes which
            suddenly light up with blue, like a ripple subsiding under a
            lily pad, or with brown, like a freshly plowed ﬁeld we vow
            we’ll drive out and look at when a certain Sunday comes in May—
and these eyes are undoubtedly Jane’s and Joe’s because they are ad­
            vancing into spring before us and tomorrow is Sunday

This poem goes on too long because our friendship has been long, long
         for this life and these times, long as art is long and un­
         interruptable,
and I would make it as long as I hope our friendship lasts if I could
         make poems that long

I hope there will be more
more drives to Bear Mountain and searches for hamburgers, more evenings
           avoiding the latest Japanese movie and watching Helen Vinson
           and Warner Baxter in Vogues of 1938 instead, more discussions
           in lobbies of the respective greatnesses of Diana Adams and
           Allegra Kent,
more sunburns and more half-mile swims in which Joe beats me as Jane
           watches, lotion-covered and sleepy, more arguments over
           Faulkner’s inferiority to Tolstoy while sand gets into my
           bathing trunks
let’s advance and change everything, but leave these little oases in
           case the heart gets thirsty en route
and I should probably propose myself as a godfather if you have any

                  Janice and Kenneth, smiling and laughing, respectively (they
                  are probably laughing at the Leaning Tower right now)
      but we are all here and have their proxy
      if Kenneth were writing this he would point out how art has changed
                  women and women have changed art and men, but men haven’t
                  changed women much
      but ideas are obscure and nothing should be obscure tonight
      you will live half the year in a house by the sea and half the year in
                  a house in our arms

Sentiments are nice, “The Lonely Crowd,”
a rift in the clouds appears above the purple,
you ﬁnd a birthday greeting card with violets
which says “a perfect friend” and means
“I love you” but the customer is forced to be
shy. It says less, as all things must.

                                     But
grease sticks to the red ribs shaped like a
sea shell, grease, light and rosy that smells of
sandalwood: it’s memory! I remember JA
staggering over to me in the San Remo and murmuring
“I’ve met someone marvellous!” That’s friendship
for you, and the sentiment of introduction.

And now that I have ﬁnished dinner I can continue.

What is it that attracts one to one? Mystery?
I think of you in Paris with a red beard, a
theological student; in London talking to a friend
who lunched with Dowager Queen Mary and offered
her his last cigarette; in Los Angeles shopping
at the Supermarket; on Mount Shasta, looking . . .
above all on Mount Shasta in your unknown youth
and photograph.
                   And then the way you straighten
people out. How ambitious you are! And that you’re
a painter is a great satisfaction, too. You know how
I feel about painters. I sometimes think poetry
only describes.
                 Now I have taken down the underwear
I washed last night from the various light ﬁxtures
and can proceed.
                    And the lift of our experiences
together, which seem to me legendary. The long subways
to our old neighborhood the near East 49th and 53rd,
and before them the laughing in bars till we cried,

      and the crying in movies till we laughed, the tenting
      tonight on the old camp grounds! How beautiful it is
      to visit someone for instant coffee! and you visiting
      Cambridge, Massachusetts, talking for two weeks worth
      in hours, and watching Maria Tallchief in the Public
      Gardens while the swan-boats slumbered. And now,
      not that I’m interrupting again, I mean your now,
      you are 82 and I am 03. And in 1984 I trust we’ll still
      be high together. I’ll say “Let’s go to a bar”
      and you’ll say “Let’s go to a movie” and we’ll go to both;
      like two old Chinese drunkards arguing about their
      favorite mountain and the million reasons for them both.

I’m having a real day of it.
                                There was
something I had to do. But what?
There are no alternatives, just
the one something.
                       I have a drink,
it doesn’t help—far from it!
                                I
feel worse. I can’t remember how
I felt, so perhaps I feel better.
No. Just a little darker.
                          If I could
get really dark, richly dark, like
being drunk, that’s the best that’s
open as a ﬁeld. Not the best,

but the best except for the impossible
pure light, to be as if above a vast
prairie, rushing and pausing over
the tiny golden heads in deep grass.

                      louise


      Sometimes I think I see a tiny ﬁgure
      sidling through the Bush. Yes, there
      at the edge of the forest, blinking in
      new light. It must have wandered up
      from Down Under. I believe it’s Maldoror!

      And now, having decided, it starts
      the weary trek across the rolling plain,
      pausing occasionally beneath a shade
      or on the gently sloping rise. It rests,
      too, on the crater of a long defunct
      volcano, lying down for a time in its
      wrinkles.
                 Then onward again, through
      the valley bounded by Twin Peaks, pink
      in the sunlight, with the scattered
      forests coming down right to the edge
      of the pass.
                    Disappearing for almost
      a day, or is it night? the toiling ﬁgure
      suddenly ﬁnds itself in a clearing.
      (Suddenly to me!) Then there is an upheaval
      rather like an earthquake. It clings
      for dear life to the nearest overhanging
      branch.
                There it is stranded in the blue
      gaze. And the gaze is astonished, eye
      to eye: a speck, and a vastness staring
      back at it. Why it’s Louise! Hi, Louise.

         failures of spring


I’m getting rather Lorcaesque lately
and I don’t like it.
                     Better if my poetry were,
instead of my lives. So many aspects of a star,

the Rudolph Valentino of sentimental reaction
to dives and crumby ex-jazz-hangouts.
                                           I
put on my sheik’s outﬁt and sit down
at the pianola,
                like when I ﬁrst discovered
aspirin.
         And I shall never make my lorcaescas
into an opera. I don’t write opera.
                                           So hot,
so hot the night my world
                            is trying to send up
                  its observation satellite.

                      two dreams of waking

     1
I stumble over furniture, I fall into a gloomy hammock
on a rainy day in Cape Cod years ago. It is a black hardoy chair.
I reach the kitchen and Joe is making coffee in the dark.
I can’t face him, because we both have to go to work
and we hate work. I look into the corner of a shelf. “Work
interrupts life,” he is muttering as he splashes in the sink.
I can’t remember what he’s doing, just that his back
was pale gold. I don’t look at it. Two white mice, big,
are running through the hole in the sleeve of my raspberry sweater.
They seem to be harming it. I shout at them. I appeal, “it’s already wearing out,”
to Joe. He looks at me coldly. “Leave them alone. They’re
playing. They have to live, too, don’t they?”
I have a hangover, and he hates me for it, and we start for work,

                         2
                  I stagger out of bed
                  and there are ﬂashes
                  of light. I stand naked
                  in a certain posture.
                  It is Larry welding a
                  ﬁgure and he says, “I’m
                  glad you’re developing breasts.
                  I want you to pose for
                  the legs of this thing.”
                  I look and I am the same.
                  “It’s all the same,” he
                  says, “I just looked at Jane’s
                  breasts. She’s menstruating
                  and the veins beneath the
                  hair on your chest are
                  just like those on her breasts.”
                  I get scared. “I’m not
                  menstruating, I’m peeing.”
                  I am. There is a chamber pot
                  forming a triangle with
                  my feet and the arc of my
                  pee slopes like a thigh.

122
It reminds me of a nude in
a painting I can’t remember.
I get scared again. “You think,”
Larry says, “that you’re safe
because you have a penis. So
do I, but we’re both wrong.”
He starts banging on the steel
again and the sound puts me
to sleep standing up. I feel
that years are going by
and I can’t talk to them or anything.

                                 ode to joy


      We shall have everything we want and there’ll be no more dying
         on the pretty plains or in the supper clubs
      for our symbol we’ll acknowledge vulgar materialistic laughter
         over an insatiable sexual appetite
      and the streets will be ﬁlled with racing forms
      and the photographs of murderers and narcissists and movie stars
         will swell from the walls and books alive in steaming rooms
         to press against our burning ﬂesh not once but interminably
      as water ﬂows down hill into the full-lipped basin
      and the adder dives for the ultimate ostrich egg
      and the feather cushion preens beneath a reclining monolith
         that’s sweating with post-exertion visibility and sweetness
         near the grave of love
                                                        No more dying

      We shall see the grave of love as a lovely sight and temporary
         near the elm that spells the lovers’ names in roots
      and there’ll be no more music but the ears in lips and no more wit
         but tongues in ears and no more drums but ears to thighs
      as evening signals nudities unknown to ancestors’ imaginations
      and the imagination itself will stagger like a tired paramour of ivory
         under the sculptural necessities of lust that never falters
         like a six-mile runner from Sweden or Liberia covered with gold
      as lava ﬂows up and over the far-down somnolent city’s abdication
      and the hermit always wanting to be lone is lone at last
      and the weight of external heat crushes the heat-hating Puritan
         whose self-defeating vice becomes a proper sepulchre at last
         that love may live

      Buildings will go up into the dizzy air as love itself goes in
        and up the reeling life that it has chosen for once or all
      while in the sky a feeling of intemperate fondness will excite the birds
        to swoop and veer like ﬂies crawling across absorbèd limbs
      that weep a pearly perspiration on the sheets of brief attention
      and the hairs dry out that summon anxious declaration of the organs
        as they rise like buildings to the needs of temporary neighbors
        pouring hunger through the heart to feed desire in intravenous ways

124
like the ways of gods with humans in the innocent combination of light
and ﬂesh or as the legends ride their heroes through the dark to found
great cities where all life is possible to maintain as long as time
   which wants us to remain for cocktails in a bar and after dinner
   lets us live with it
                                                  No more dying


                                                                 1957

                      ode to willem de kooning


      Beyond the sunrise
      where the black begins
                                         an enormous city
                                         is sending up its shutters

      and just before the last lapse of nerve which I am already sorry for,
      that friends describe as “just this once” in a temporary hell, I hope

      I try to seize upon greatness
      which is available to me
                                         through generosity and
                                         lavishness of spirit, yours
      not to be inimitably weak
      and picturesque, my self
                                         but to be standing clearly
                                         alone in the orange wind

      while our days tumble and rant through Gotham and the Easter narrows
      and I have not the courage to convict myself of cowardice or care

      for now a long history slinks over the sill, or patent absurdities
      and the fathomless miseries of a small person upset by personality

      and I look to the ﬂags
      in your eyes as they go up
                                         on the enormous walls
                                         as the brave must always ascend
      into the air, always the musts
      like banderillas dangling

      and jingling jewellike amidst the red drops on the shoulders of men
      who lead us not forward or backward, but on as we must go on

                                         out into the mesmerized world
                                         of inanimate voices like trafﬁc
      noises, hewing a clearing
      in the crowded abyss of the West

126
                     2
               Stars of all passing sights,
               language, thought and reality,
               “I am assuming that one knows
               what it is to be ashamed”
               and that the light we seek
               is broad and pure, not winking
               and that the evil inside us
               now and then strolls into a ﬁeld
               and sits down like a forgotten rock
               while we walk on to a horizon
               line that’s beautifully keen,
               precarious and doesn’t sag
               beneath our variable weight

               In this dawn as in the ﬁrst
               it’s the Homeric rose, its scent
               that leads us up the rocky path
               into the pass where death
               can disappear or where the face
               of future senses may appear
               in a white night that opens
               after the embattled hours of day

               And the wind tears up the rose
               fountains of prehistoric light
               falling upon the blinded heroes
               who did not see enough or were not
               mad enough or felt too little
               when the blood began to pour down
               the rocky slopes into pink seas

   3
Dawn must always recur
                            to blot out stars and the terrible systems
of belief
            Dawn, which dries out the web so the wind can blow it,
                           spider and all, away

                                                                         127
      Dawn,
              erasing blindness from an eye inﬂamed,
                                                        reaching for its
      morning cigarette in Promethean inﬂection
                                                     after the blames
      and desperate conclusions of the dark
                                               where messages were intercepted
      by an ignorant horde of thoughts
                                          and all simplicities perished in desire

      A bus crashes into a milk truck
                                        and the girl goes skating up the avenue
      with streaming hair
                          roaring through ﬂuttering newspapers
      and their Athenian contradictions
                                          for democracy is joined
      with stunning collapsible savages, all natural and relaxed and free

      as the day zooms into space and only darkness lights our lives,
      with few ﬂags ﬂaming, imperishable courage and the gentle will
      which is the individual dawn of genius rising from its bed

      “maybe they’re wounds, but maybe they are rubies”
                                                              each painful as a sun

                         poem


I live above a dyke bar and I’m happy.
The police car is always near the door
                                        in case they cry
or the key doesn’t work in the lock. But
            he can’t open it either. So we go to Joan’s
and sleep over
               Bridget and Joe and I.

I meet Mike for a beer in the Cedar as
the wind ﬂops up the Place, pushing the leaves
against the streetlights. And Norman tells about

the geste,
         with the individual signiﬁcance of a hardon
like humanity.
               We go to Irma’s for Bloody Marys,

and then it’s dark.
We played with her cat and it fell asleep. We
seem very mild. It’s humid out. (Are they spelled “dikes”?)
People say they are Bacchantes, but if they are

we must be the survivors of Thermopylae.

                                                              129
ode to michael goldberg (’s birth and other births)


 I don’t remember anything of then, down there around the magnolias
           where I was no more comfortable than I’ve been since
           though aware of a certain neutrality called satisfaction
           sometimes

 and there’s never been an opportunity to think of it as an idyll
 as if everyone’d been singing around me, or around a tulip tree

 a faint stirring of that singing seems to come to me in heavy trafﬁc
 but I can’t be sure that’s it, it may be some more recent singing
 from hours of dusk in bushes playing tag, being called in, walking
        up onto the porch crying bitterly because it wasn’t a veranda
 “smell that honeysuckle?” or a door you can see through terribly clearly,
                even the mosquitoes saw through it
 suffocating netting
 or more often being put into a brown velvet suit and kicked around
 perhaps that was my last real cry for myself
 in a forest you think of birds, in trafﬁc you think of tires,
                where are you?
 in Baltimore you think of hats and shoes, like Daddy did

                  I hardly ever think of June 27, 1926
                  when I came moaning into my mother’s world
                  and tried to make it mine immediately
                  by screaming, sucking, urinating
                  and carrying on generally
                  it was quite a day

 I wasn’t proud of my penis yet, how did I know how to act? it was 1936
 “no excuses, now”


       Yellow morning
                        silent, wet
                                      blackness under the trees over stone walls
 hay, smelling faintly of semen
                                  a few sheltered ﬂowers nodding and smiling

130
at the clattering cutter-bar
                               of the mower ridden by Jimmy Whitney
“I’d like to put my rolling-pin to her”                     his brother Bailey
leaning on his pitchfork, watching
                                      “you shove it in and nine months later
it comes out a kid”
                              Ha ha       where those ﬂowers would dry out
and never again be seen
                           except as cow-ﬂaps, hushed noon drinking cold
water in the dusty ﬁeld       “their curly throats”      big milk cans

               full of cold spring water, sandy hair, black hair

                    I went to my ﬁrst movie
                    and the hero got his legs
                    cut off by a steam engine
                    in a freightyard, in my second

                    Karen Morley got shot
                    in the back by an arrow
                    I think she was an heiress
                    it came through her bathroom door

                    there was nobody there
                    there never was anybody
                    there at any time
                    in sweet-smelling summer

I’d like to stay
                    in this ﬁeld forever
                                                and think of nothing
but these sounds,
                    these smells and the tickling grasses
                                                “up your ass, Sport”


                    Up on the mountainous hill
                    behind the confusing house
                                                                                 131
                       where I lived, I went each
                       day after school and some nights
                       with my various dogs, the
                       terrier that bit people, Arno
                       the shepherd (who used to
                       be wild but had stopped), the
                       wire-haired that took ﬁts
                       and ﬁnally the boring gentle
                       cocker, spotted brown and white,
                        named Freckles        there,

                       the wind sounded exactly like
                       Stravinsky
                                   I ﬁrst recognized art
                       as wildness, and it seemed right,
                                   I mean rite, to me

                       climbing the water tower I’d
                       look out for hours in wind
                       and the world seemed rounder
                       and ﬁercer and I was happier
                       because I wasn’t scared of falling off

                       nor off the horses, the horses!
                       to hell with the horses, bay and black

            It’s odd to have secrets at an early age, trysts
      whose thoughtfulness and sweetness are those of a very aggressive person
                 carried beneath your shirt like an amulet against your sire
                    what one must do is done in a red twilight
                           on colossally old and dirty furniture with knobs,
                    and on Sunday afternoons you meet in a high place
                    watching the Sunday drivers and the symphonic sadness
                 stopped, a man in a convertible put his hand up a girl’s skirt
             and again the twitching odor of hay, like a minor irritation
      that gives you a hardon, and again the roundness of horse noises

                  but unhappiness, like Mercury, transﬁxed me
           there, un repaire de vipères
                  and had I known the strength and durability
of those invisible bonds I would have leaped from rafters onto prongs
then
          and been carried shining and intact
          to the Indian Cemetery near the lake
                                                          but there is a glistening
                                                          blackness in the center
                                                          if you seek it
here . . .     it’s capable of bursting
               into ﬂame or merely
               gleaming profoundly in
                                                          the platinum setting
                                                          of your ornamental
                                                          human ties and hates
hanging between breasts
                              or, crosslike, on a chest of hairs
the center of myself is never silent
                                             the wind soars, keening overhead
and the vestments of unnatural safety
                                             part to reveal a foreign land
toward whom I have been selected to bear
                                                  the gift of ﬁre
                      the temporary place of light, the land of air

down where a ﬂame illumines gravity and means warmth and insight,
     where air is ﬂesh, where speed is darkness
and
     things can suddenly be reached, held, dropped and known

where a not totally imaginary ascent can begin all over again in tears


         A couple of speciﬁcally anguished days
         make me now distrust sorrow, simple sorrow
         especially, like sorrow over death
                                                                                      133
              it makes you wonder who you are to be sorrowful
              over death, death belonging to another
              and suddenly inhabited by you without permission

              you moved in impulsively and took it up
              declaring your Squatters’ Rights in howls
              or screaming with rage, like a parvenu in a Chinese laundry

              disbelieving your own feelings is the worst
              and you suspect that you are jealous of this death

                YIPPEE! I’m glad I’m alive
                                                “I’m glad you’re alive
            too, baby, because I want to fuck you”
                                                     you are pink
            and despicable in the warm breeze drifting in the window
      and the rent
                     is due, in honor of which you have borrowed $34.96 from Joe
      and it’s all over but the smoldering hatred of pleasure
            a gorgeous purple like somebody’s favorite tie
                “Shit, that means you’re getting kind of ascetic, doesn’t it?”


                       So I left, the stars were shining
                       like the lights around a swimming pool

                        you’ve seen a lot of anemones, too
                        haven’t you, Old Paint? through the
                        Painted Desert to the orange covered
                        slopes where a big hill was moving in
                        on L A and other stars were strolling
                        in shorts down palm-stacked horse-walks
                        and I stared with my strained SP stare
                        wearing a gun
                                        the doubts
              of a life devoted to leaving rumors of love for new
      from does she love me to do I love him,

                   reclining outside his hut in Lamourish languor
                   and an atabrine-dyed hat like a sick sun

                   he has had his balls sewed into his mouth
                   by the natives who bleach their hair in urine

      but more killing still the absence of desire, which in religion
                                         used to be called hope,
I don’t just mean the lack of a hardon, which may be sincerity
                    or the last-minute victory of the proud spirit over ﬂesh,
      no: a tangerinelike sullenness in the face of sunrise
                    or a dark sinking in the wind on the forecastle
      when someone you love hits your head and says “I’d sail with you any

                                              churning the earth
  even under the fathomless deaths
                                       below, beneath
                                                           where the one special

henceforth to be called small

although its people could say “Mare nostrum” without fear of hubris
and the air saluted them
                          (air of the stars) ashore or leaning on the prow


                                                                     1958

                There is the sense of neurotic coherence

                you think maybe poetry is too important and you like that

                suddenly everyone’s supposed to be veined, like marble

                it isn’t that simple but it’s simple enough

                the rock is least living of the forms man has fucked

                and it isn’t pathetic and it’s lasting, one towering tree

                in the vast smile of bronze and vertiginous grasses

      Maude lays down her doll, red wagon and her turtle
      takes my hand and comes with us, shows the bronze jackson pollock
      gazelling on the rock of her demeanor as a child, says running
      away hand in hand “he isn’t under there, he’s out in the woods” beyond

      and like that child at your grave make me be distant and imaginative
      make my lines thin as ice, then swell like pythons
      the color of Aurora when she ﬁrst brought ﬁre to the Arctic in a sled
      a sexual bliss inscribe upon the page of whatever energy I burn for art
      and do not watch over my life, but read and read through copper earth

      not to fall at all, but disappear or burn! seizing a grave by throat
      which is the look of earth, its ambiguity of light and sound
      the thickness in a look of lust, the air within the eye
      the gasp of a moving hand as maps change and faces become vacant
      it’s noble to refuse to be added up or divided, ﬁnality of kings


                            and there’s the ugliness we seek in vain
      through life and long for like a mortuarian Baudelaire working for Skouras
      inhabiting neighborhoods of Lear! Lear! Lear!
                                                       tenement of a single heart

for Old Romance was draping dolors on a scarlet mound, each face
a country of valorous decay, heath-helmet or casque, mollement, moelleusement
and all that shining ﬁerce turned green and covered the lays with grass
as later in The Orange Ballad of Cromwell’s Charm Upon the Height “So Green”
as in the histories of that same time and earlier, when written down at all
sweet scripts to obfuscate the tender subjects of their future lays

to be layed at all! romanticized, elaborated, fucked, sung, put to “rest”
is worse than the mild apprehension of a Buddhist type caught halfway up
the tea-rose trellis with his sickle banging on the Monk’s lead window, moon
not our moon
                unless the tea exude a little gas and poisonous fact
to reach the spleen and give it a dreamless twinge that love’s love’s near

    the bang of alertness, loneliness, position that prehends experience


not much to be less, not much to be more
                                              alive, sick; and dead, dying
like the kiss of love meeting the kiss of hatred
                                                  “oh you know why”

                                                            what goes up must
come down, what dooms must do, standing still and walking in New York

let us walk in that nearby forest, staring into the growling trees
in which an era of pompous frivolity or two is dangling its knobby knees
and reaching for an audience
                                over the pillar of our deaths a cloud
heaves
        pushed, steaming and blasted
                                          love-propelled and tangled glitteringly
                            has earned himself the title Bird in Flight

            ode: salute to the french negro poets


      From near the sea, like Whitman my great predecessor, I call
      to the spirits of other lands to make fecund my existence

      do not spare your wrath upon our shores, that trees may grow
      upon the sea, mirror of our total mankind in the weather

      one who no longer remembers dancing in the heat of the moon may call
      across the shifting sands, trying to live in the terrible western world


      here where to love at all’s to be a politician, as to love a poem
      is pretentious, this may sound tendentious but it’s lyrical

      which shows what lyricism has been brought to by our fabled times
      where cowards are shibboleths and one speciﬁc love’s traduced

      by shame for what you love more generally and never would avoid
      where reticence is paid for by a poet in his blood or ceasing to be


      blood! blood that we have mountains in our veins to stand off jackals
      in the pillaging of our desires and allegiances, Aimé Césaire

      for if there is fortuity it’s in the love we bear each other’s differences
      in race which is the poetic ground on which we rear our smiles

      standing in the sun of marshes as we wade slowly toward the culmination
      of a gift which is categorically the most difﬁcult relationship


      and should be sought as such because it is our nature, nothing
      inspires us but the love we want upon the frozen face of earth

      and utter disparagement turns into praise as generations read the message
      of our hearts in adolescent closets who once shot at us in doorways



144
or kept us from living freely because they were too young then to know
what they would ultimately need from a barren and heart-sore life


the beauty of America, neither cool jazz nor devoured Egyptian heroes, lies in
lives in the darkness I inhabit in the midst of sterile millions

the only truth is face to face, the poem whose words become your mouth
and dying in black and white we ﬁght for what we love, not are


                                                                         1958

      a true account of talking
       to the sun at fire island


      The Sun woke me this morning loud
      and clear, saying “Hey! I’ve been
      trying to wake you up for ﬁfteen
      minutes. Don’t be so rude, you are
      only the second poet I’ve ever chosen
      to speak to personally
                               so why
      aren’t you more attentive? If I could
      burn you through the window I would
      to wake you up. I can’t hang around
      here all day.”
                      “Sorry, Sun, I stayed
      up late last night talking to Hal.”

      “When I woke up Mayakovsky he was
      a lot more prompt” the Sun said
      petulantly. “Most people are up
      already waiting to see if I’m going
      to put in an appearance.”
                                    I tried
      to apologize “I missed you yesterday.”
      “That’s better” he said. “I didn’t
      know you’d come out.” “You may be
      wondering why I’ve come so close?”
      “Yes” I said beginning to feel hot
      wondering if maybe he wasn’t burning me
      anyway.
                “Frankly I wanted to tell you
      I like your poetry. I see a lot
      on my rounds and you’re okay. You may
      not be the greatest thing on earth, but
      you’re different. Now, I’ve heard some
      say you’re crazy, they being excessively
      calm themselves to my mind, and other



146
crazy poets think that you’re a boring
reactionary. Not me.
                       Just keep on
like I do and pay no attention. You’ll
ﬁnd that people always will complain
about the atmosphere, either too hot
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.
                        If you don’t appear
at all one day they think you’re lazy
or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.

And don’t worry about your lineage
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on
the jungle, you know, on the tundra
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting
for you to get to work.

                       And now that you
are making your own days, so to speak,
even if no one reads you but me
you won’t be depressed. Not
everyone can look up, even at me. It
hurts their eyes.”
                   “Oh Sun, I’m so grateful to you!”

“Thanks and remember I’m watching. It’s
easier for me to speak to you out
here. I don’t have to slide down
between buildings to get your ear.
I know you love Manhattan, but
you ought to look up more often.
                                   And
always embrace things, people earth

      the appropriate sense of space. That
      is your inclination, known in the heavens
      and you should follow it to hell, if
      necessary, which I doubt.
                                   Maybe we’ll
      speak again in Africa, of which I too
      am specially fond. Go back to sleep now
      Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem
      in that brain of yours as my farewell.”

      “Sun, don’t go!” I was awake
      at last. “No, go I must, they’re calling
      me.”
              “Who are they?”
                                Rising he said “Some
      day you’ll know. They’re calling to you
      too.” Darkly he rose, and then I slept.

                            In memory of Bunny Lang

      As happiness takes off the tie it borrowed from me
      and gets into bed and pretends to be asleep-and-awake
      or pulls an orange poncho over its blonde Jay-Thorped curls
      and goes off to cocktails without telling me why
      it’s so depressing,
                          so I will be as unhappy as I damn well
      please and not make too much of it because I am
      really here and not in a novel or anything or a jet plane
      as I’ve often gone away on a ladder, a taxi or a jet plane

            everybody thinks if you go, you go up
      but I’m not so sure about that because the fault of my generation
      is that nobody wants to make a big histoire about anything
      and I’m just like everybody else, if an earthquake comes
      laughingly along and gulps down the whole of Madrid
      including the Manzanares River and for dessert all the royal tombs
      in the Escorial I’d only get kind of hysterical about one person
      no Voltaire me
                       and isn’t it funny how beautiful Sibelius sounds
      if you haven’t found him for a long time? because if we didn’t all
      hang onto a little self-conscious bitterness and call it intelligence
      and admire it as technique we would all be perfectly truthful
      and fall into the vat of longing and suffocate in its suet
      except for the two Gregorys
                                      Lafayette who was so pointlessly handsome
      and innocently blond that he cheerfully died
                                                       and Corso
      too lustrously dark and precise, he would be excavated and declared
      a black diamond and hung round a slender bending neck
      in the 26th Century when the Court of the Bourbons is reinstated
      and heaven comes to resemble more closely a late Goya

            this isn’t bitterness, it’s merely a tremor of the earth
      I’m impersonating some wretch weeping over a 1956 date book and of course
      I pull myself together and then I wipe my eyes and see that it’s my own
                                    (date book, that is)
      and everything becomes history: when Lennie Bernstein conducted it

on TV last week he called it my Symphony Number One, my “Unﬁnished”
that sort of thing can give you a terrible feeling that you’ve
                           accomplished something

meanwhile, back at the Paris branch of contemporary depression, I
am dropping through the famous blueness like a pearl diver, I am
looking for Gregory who lives on Heart-Bed Street and I sit with Ashbery
in the Flore because of his poem about himself in a ﬂower-bed
and we look for Gregory in the Deux Magots because I want to cry with him
about a dear dead friend, it’s always about dying, never about death
I sometimes think it’s the only reason that any of us love each other
it is raining, Ashes helps me ﬁnish my gall and seltzer, and we go

         the casual reader will not, I am sure, be averse to a short
         digression in this splendid narrative by which the nature
         of the narrator can be more or less revealed and all sorts
         of things subsequently become clearer if not clear: picture
         a person who one day in a ﬁt of idleness decides to make
         a pomander like the one that granny used to have around the
         house in old New England and so he takes an orange and sticks
         a lot of cloves in it and then he looks at it and realizes
         that he’s killed the orange, his favorite which came from
         the Malay Archipelago and was even loved in Ancient China,
         and he quickly pulls out all the cloves, but it’s too
         late! Orange is lying bleeding in my hand! and I
         suddenly think of the moon, hanging quietly up there
         ever since the time of Keats, and now they’re shoot­
         ing all those funny-looking things at her, that’s
         what you get, baby (end of digression)


and back in New York Gregory is back in New York and we are still missing
each other in the Cedar and in hotel lobbies where Salvador Dali is
supposed to be asleep and at Anne Truxell’s famous giggling parties
until one ﬁne day (vedremo) we meet over a duck dinner, good god
I just remembered what he stuffed it with, you guessed it: oranges!
and perhaps, too, he is the true narrator of this story, Gregory

                                                                            153
      no, I must be, because he’s in Chicago, and after all those months
      including Madrid where it turns out there wasn’t any earthquake
      and also the TV broadcast was cancelled because Bernstein had a sore
      thumb, I’m not depressed any more, because Gregory has had the same
      experience with oranges, and is alive

               where all memories grow into childhood
               and mingled sound and silence drifts up to the rooftop
               where a bare-legged boy stares into the future
               takes up the knives of his wounds to catch the light
               foreseeing his epic triumph in the style of Cecil B. De Mille
               when one day the Via del Corso is named after him
               the principal street of Rome
               which is better than the Nobel Prize
               better than Albert Schweitzer, Pablo Casals and Helen Keller

think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore or
Brendan Behan’s new play or Le Balcon or Les Nègres
of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine
after practically going to sleep with quandariness

and for Mike I just stroll into the park lane
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton
of Picayunes, and a new york post with her face on it

      does it look dirty
      that’s what you think of in the city

      does it just seem dirty
      that’s what you think of in the city
      you don’t refuse to breathe do you

      someone comes along with a very bad character
      he seems attractive. is he really. yes. very
      he’s attractive as his character is bad. is it. yes

      that’s what you think of in the city
      run your ﬁnger along your no-moss mind
      that’s not a thought that’s soot

      and you take a lot of dirt off someone
      is the character less bad. no. it improves constantly

                adieu to norman,
          bon jour to joan and jean-paul


It is 12:10 in New York and I am wondering
if I will ﬁnish this in time to meet Norman for lunch
ah lunch! I think I am going crazy
what with my terrible hangover and the weekend coming up
at excitement-prone Kenneth Koch’s
I wish I were staying in town and working on my poems
at Joan’s studio for a new book by Grove Press
which they will probably not print
but it is good to be several ﬂoors up in the dead of night
wondering whether you are any good or not
and the only decision you can make is that you did it

yesterday I looked up the rue Frémicourt on a map
and was happy to ﬁnd it like a bird
ﬂying over Paris et ses environs
which unfortunately did not include Seine-et-Oise which I don’t know
as well as a number of other things
and Allen is back talking about god a lot
and Peter is back not talking very much
and Joe has a cold and is not coming to Kenneth’s
although he is coming to lunch with Norman
I suspect he is making a distinction
well, who isn’t

I wish I were reeling around Paris
instead of reeling around New York
I wish I weren’t reeling at all
it is Spring the ice has melted the Ricard is being poured
we are all happy and young and toothless
it is the same as old age
the only thing to do is simply continue
is that simple
yes, it is simple because it is the only thing to do
can you do it
yes, you can because it is the only thing to do
blue light over the Bois de Boulogne it continues

                                                                       159
 the Seine continues
 the Louvre stays open it continues it hardly closes at all
 the Bar Américain continues to be French
 de Gaulle continues to be Algerian as does Camus
 Shirley Goldfarb continues to be Shirley Goldfarb
 and Jane Hazan continues to be Jane Freilicher (I think!)
 and Irving Sandler continues to be the balayeur des artistes
 and so do I (sometimes I think I’m “in love” with painting)
 and surely the Piscine Deligny continues to have water in it
 and the Flore continues to have tables and newspapers and people under them
 and surely we shall not continue to be unhappy
 we shall be happy
 but we shall continue to be ourselves everything continues to be possible
 René Char, Pierre Reverdy, Samuel Beckett it is possible isn’t it
 I love Reverdy for saying yes, though I don’t believe it


                                                                       1959

                              joe’s jacket


Entraining to Southampton in the parlor car with Jap and Vincent, I
see life as a penetrable landscape lit from above
like it was in my Barbizonian kiddy days when automobiles
were owned by the same people for years and the Alfa Romeo was
only a rumor under the leaves beside the viaduct and I
pretending to be adult felt the blue within me and the light up there
no central ﬁgure me, I was some sort of cloud or a gust of wind
at the station a crowd of drunken ﬁshermen on a picnic Kenneth
is hard to ﬁnd but we ﬁnd, through all the singing, Kenneth smiling
it is off to Janice’s blueﬁsh and the incessant talk of affection
expressed as excitability and spleen to be recent and strong
and not unbearably right in attitude, full of conﬁdences
now I will say it, thank god, I knew you would

an enormous party mesmerizing corners in the disgathering light
and dancing miniature-endless, like a pivot
I drink to smother my sensitivity for a while so I won’t stare away
I drink to kill the fear of boredom, the mounting panic of it
I drink to reduce my seriousness so a certain spurious charm
can appear and win its ﬂickering little victory over noise
I drink to die a little and increase the contrast of this questionable moment
and then I am going home, purged of everything except anxiety and self-distrust
now I will say it, thank god, I knew you would
and the rain has commenced its delicate lament over the orchards

an enormous window morning and the wind, the beautiful desperation of a tree
ﬁghting off strangulation, and my bed has an ugly calm
I reach to the D. H. Lawrence on the ﬂoor and read “The Ship of Death”
I lie back again and begin slowly to drift and then to sink
a somnolent envy of inertia makes me rise naked and go to the window
where the car horn mysteriously starts to honk, no one is there
and Kenneth comes out and stops it in the soft green lightless stare
and we are soon in the Paris of Kenneth’s libretto, I did not drift
away I did not die I am there with Haussmann and the rue de Rivoli
and the spirits of beauty, art and progress, pertinent and mobile
in their worldly way, and musical and strange the sun comes out


                                                                            161
returning by car the forceful histories of myself and Vincent loom
like the city hour after hour closer and closer to the future I am here
and the night is heavy though not warm, Joe is still up and we talk
only of the immediate present and its indiscriminately hitched-to past
the feeling of life and incident pouring over the sleeping city
which seems to be bathed in an unobtrusive light which lends things
coherence and an absolute, for just that time as four o’clock goes by

and soon I am rising for the less than average day, I have coffee
I prepare calmly to face almost everything that will come up I am calm
but not as my bed was calm as it softly declined to become a ship
I borrow Joe’s seersucker jacket though he is still asleep I start out
when I last borrowed it I was leaving there it was on my Spanish plaza back
and hid my shoulders from San Marco’s pigeons was jostled on the Kurfürstendamm
and sat opposite Ashes in an enormous leather chair in the Continental
it is all enormity and life it has protected me and kept me here on
many occasions as a symbol does when the heart is full and risks no speech
a precaution I loathe as the pheasant loathes the season and is preserved
it will not be need, it will be just what it is and just what happens


                                                                          1959




 162
            you are gorgeous and i’m coming


Vaguely I hear the purple roar of the torn-down Third Avenue El
it sways slightly but ﬁrmly like a hand or a golden-downed thigh
normally I don’t think of sounds as colored unless I’m feeling corrupt
concrete Rimbaud obscurity of emotion which is simple and very deﬁnite
even lasting, yes it may be that dark and purifying wave, the death of boredom
nearing the heights themselves may destroy you in the pure air
to be further complicated, confused, empty but reﬁlling, exposed to light

With the past falling away as an acceleration of nerves thundering and shaking
aims its aggregating force like the Métro towards a realm of encircling travel
rending the sound of adventure and becoming ultimately local and intimate
repeating the phrases of an old romance which is constantly renewed by the
endless originality of human loss the air the stumbling quiet of breathing
newly the heavens’ stars all out we are all for the captured time of our being


                                                                         1959

                                   poem


  The ﬂuorescent tubing burns like a bobby-soxer’s ankles
  the white paint the green leaves in an old champagne bottle
  and the formica shelves going up in the ofﬁce
  and the formica desk-tops over the white ﬂoor
  what kind of an ofﬁce is this anyway
  I am so nervous about my life the little of it I can get ahold of
  so I call up Kenneth in Southampton and presto
  he is leaning on the shelf in the kitchen three hours away
  while Janice is drying her hair which has prevented her from hearing
  my voice through the telephone company ear-blacker
  why black a clean ear
  Kenneth you are really the backbone of a tremendous poetry nervous system
  which keeps sending messages along the wireless luxuriance
  of distraught experiences and hysterical desires so to keep things humming
  and have nothing go off the trackless tracks
  and once more you have balanced me precariously
  on the wilderness wish
  of wanting to be everything to everybody everywhere
  as the vigor of Africa through the corridor
  the sands of Sahara still tickle in my jockey shorts
  the air-conditioner grunts like that Eskimo dad
  and the phone clicks as your glasses bump the receiver
  to say we are in America and it is all right not to be elsewhere


                                                                       1959

              “l’amour avait passé par là”


Yes
like the still center of a book on Joan Miró
blue red green and white
a slightly over-gold edition of Hart Crane
and the huge mirror behind me blinking, paint-ﬂecked
they have painted the ceiling of my heart
and put in a new light ﬁxture
and Arte Contemporáneo by Juan Eduardo Cirlot
and the Petit Guide to the Musée National Russe
it is all blankly defending its privacy
from the sighing wind in the ceiling
of the old Theatre Guild building
on West 53rd Street
near the broken promises of casualness
to get to the Cedar to meet Grace
I must tighten my moccasins
and forget the minute bibliographies of disappointment
anguish and power
for unrelaxed honesty
this laissez-passer for chance and misery, but taut
a candle held to the window has two ﬂames
and perhaps a horde of followers in the rain of youth
as under the arch you ﬁnd a heart of lipstick or a condom
left by the parade
of a generalized intuition
it is the great period of Italian art when everyone imitates Picasso
afraid to mean anything
as the second ﬂame in its happy reﬂecting ignores the candle and the wind


                                                                    1959

                          poem


      Hate is only one of many responses
      true, hurt and hate go hand in hand
      but why be afraid of hate, it is only there

      think of ﬁlth, is it really awesome
      neither is hate
      don’t be shy of unkindness, either
      it’s cleansing and allows you to be direct
      like an arrow that feels something

      out and out meanness, too, lets love breathe
      you don’t have to ﬁght off getting in too deep
      you can always get out if you’re not too scared

      an ounce of prevention’s
      enough to poison the heart
      don’t think of others
      until you have thought of yourself, are true

      all of these things, if you feel them
      will be graced by a certain reluctance
      and turn into gold

      if felt by me, will be smilingly deﬂected
      by your mysterious concern

                               poem


I don’t know as I get what D. H. Lawrence is driving at
when he writes of lust springing from the bowels
or do I
it could be the bowels of the earth
to lie ﬂat on the earth in spring, summer or winter is sexy
you feel it stirring deep down slowly up to you
and sometimes it gives you a little nudge in the crotch
that’s very sexy
and when someone looks sort of raggedy and dirty like Paulette Goddard
in Modern Times it’s exciting, it isn’t usual or attractive
perhaps D.H.L. is thinking of the darkness
certainly the crotch is light
and I suppose
any part of us that can only be seen by others
is a dark part
I feel that about the small of my back, too and the nape of my neck
they are dark
they are erotic zones as in the tropics
whereas Paris is straightforward and bright about it all
a coal miner has kind of a sexy occupation
though I’m sure it’s painful down there
but so is lust
of light we can never have enough
but how would we ﬁnd it
unless the darkness urged us on and into it
and I am dark
except when now and then it all comes clear
and I can see myself
as others luckily sometimes see me
in a good light


                                                                 1959

                 personal poem


      Now when I walk around at lunchtime
      I have only two charms in my pocket
      an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me
      and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case
      when I was in Madrid the others never
      brought me too much luck though they did
      help keep me in New York against coercion
      but now I’m happy for a time and interested

      I walk through the luminous humidity
      passing the House of Seagram with its wet
      and its loungers and the construction to
      the left that closed the sidewalk if
      I ever get to be a construction worker
      I’d like to have a silver hat please
      and get to Moriarty’s where I wait for
      LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and
      shaker the last ﬁve years my batting average
      is .016 that’s that, and LeRoi comes in
      and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12
      times last night outside birdland by a cop
      a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible
      disease but we don’t give her one we
      don’t like terrible diseases, then
      we go eat some ﬁsh and some ale it’s
      cool but crowded we don’t like Lionel Trilling
      we decide, we like Don Allen we don’t like
      Henry James so much we like Herman Melville
      we don’t want to be in the poets’ walk in
      San Francisco even we just want to be rich
      and walk on girders in our silver hats




168
I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is
thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi
and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go
back to work happy at the thought possibly so

      post the lake poets ballad


       Moving slowly sweating a lot
       I am pushed by a gentle breeze
       outside the Paradise Bar on
               St. Mark’s Place and I breathe

       and bourbon with Joe he says
       did you see a letter from Larry
       in the mailbox what a shame I didn’t
               I wonder what it says

       and then we eat and go to
       The Horse Riders and my bum aches
       from the hard seats and boredom
              is hard too we don’t go

       to the Cedar it’s so hot out
       and I read the letter which says
       in your poems your gorgeous self-pity
               how do you like that

       that is odd I think of myself
       as a cheerful type who pretends to
       be hurt to get a little depth into
                things that interest me

       and I’ve even given that up
       lately with the stream of events
       going so fast and the movingly
               alternating with the amusingly

       the depth all in the ocean
       although I’m different in the winter
       of course even this is a complaint
               but I’m happy anyhow

      Ah Jean Dubuffet
      when you think of him
      doing his military service in the Eiffel Tower
      as a meteorologist
      in 1922
      you know how wonderful the 20th Century
      can be
      and the gaited Iroquois on the girders
      ﬁerce and unﬂinching-footed
      nude as they should be
      slightly empty
      like a Sonia Delaunay
      there is a parable of speed
      somewhere behind the Indians’ eyes
      they invented the century with their horses
      and their fragile backs
      which are dark

      we owe a debt to the Iroquois
      and to Duke Ellington
      for playing in the buildings when they are built
      we don’t do much ourselves
      but fuck and think
      of the haunting Métro
      and the one who didn’t show up there
      while we were waiting to become part of our century
      just as you can’t make a hat out of steel
      and still wear it
      who wears hats anyway
      it is our tribe’s custom
      to beguile

      how are you feeling in ancient September
      I am feeling like a truck on a wet highway
      how can you
      you were made in the image of god
      I was not

I was made in the image of a sissy truck-driver

      everything is vicious and cruel

      we are back in reality

      and the Austro-Hungarian empire
      was initiating trouble
      a lot of trouble
      there was a germ of outrageous desire
      it lodged in our hearts
      it will never succumb it is within us
      it will never die
      but we shall die
      and awaken from our torment
      in a storm of anguish
      which is just
      octaves of war
      pound through my willing brain

Khrushchev is coming on the right day!
                                               the cool graced light
is pushed off the enormous glass piers by hard wind
and everything is tossing, hurrying on up
                                              this country
has everything but politesse, a Puerto Rican cab driver says
and ﬁve different girls I see
                               look like Piedie Gimbel
with her blonde hair tossing too,
                                       as she looked when I pushed
her little daughter on the swing on the lawn it was also windy

last night we went to a movie and came out,
                                                Ionesco is greater
than Beckett, Vincent said, that’s what I think, blueberry blintzes
and Khrushchev was probably being carped at
                                                   in Washington, no politesse
Vincent tells me about his mother’s trip to Sweden
                                                       Hans tells us
about his father’s life in Sweden, it sounds like Grace Hartigan’s
painting Sweden
                 so I go home to bed and names drift through my head
Purgatorio Merchado, Gerhard Schwartz and Gaspar Gonzales, all
        unknown ﬁgures of the early morning as I go to work

where does the evil of the year go
                                      when September takes New York
and turns it into ozone stalagmites
                                     deposits of light
                                     so I get back up
make coffee, and read François Villon, his life, so dark
     New York seems blinding and my tie is blowing up the street
I wish it would blow off
                         though it is cold and somewhat warms my neck




                                                                                 175
      as the train bears Khrushchev on to Pennsylvania Station
            and the light seems to be eternal
            and joy seems to be inexorable
            I am foolish enough always to ﬁnd it in wind

I cough a lot (sinus?) so I
get up and have some tea with cognac
it is dawn
            the light ﬂows evenly along the lawn
in chilly Southampton and I smoke
and hours and hours go by I read
van Vechten’s Spider Boy then a short
story by Patsy Southgate and a poem
by myself it is cold and I shiver a little
in white shorts the day begun
so oddly not tired not nervous I
am for once truly awake letting it all

grabbing on late as usual

to get the dog in Sag Harbor I make
myself a bourbon and commence
to write one of my “I do this I do that”

      The spent purpose of a perfectly marvellous
      life suddenly glimmers and leaps into ﬂame
      it’s more difﬁcult than you think to make charcoal
      it’s also pretty hard to remember life’s marvellous
      but there it is guttering choking then soaring
      in the mirrored room of this consciousness
      it’s practically a blaze of pure sensibility
      and however exaggerated at least something’s going on
      and the quick oxygen in the air will not go neglected
      will not sulk or fall into blackness and peat

      an angel ﬂying slowly, curiously singes its wings
      and you diminish for a moment out of respect
      for beauty then ﬂare up after all that’s the angel
      that wrestled with Jacob and loves conﬂict
      as an athlete loves the tape, and we’re off into
      an immortal contest of actuality and pride
      which is love assuming the consciousness of itself
      as sky over all, medium of ﬁnding and founding
      not just resemblance but the magnetic otherness
      that that that stands erect in the spirit’s glare
      and waits for the joining of an opposite force’s breath

      so come the winds into our lives and last
      longer than despair’s sharp snake, crushed before it conquered
      so marvellous is not just a poet’s greenish namesake
      and we live outside his garden in our tempestuous rights


                                                                1959

Ah nuts! It’s boring reading French newspapers
in New York as if I were a Colonial waiting for my gin
somewhere beyond this roof a jet is making a sketch of the sky
where is Gary Snyder I wonder if he’s reading under a dwarf pine
stretched out so his book and his head ﬁt under the lowest branch
while the sun of the Orient rolls calmly not getting through to him
not caring particularly because the light in Japan respects poets

while in Paris Monsieur Martory and his brother Jean the poet
are reading a piece by Matthieu Galey and preparing to send a pneu
everybody here is running around after dull pleasantries and
wondering if The Hotel Wentley Poems is as great as I say it is
and I am feeling particularly testy at being separated from
the one I love by the most dreary of practical exigencies money
when I want only to lean on my elbow and stare into space feeling
the one warm beautiful thing in the world breathing upon my right rib

what are lutes they make ugly twangs and rest on knees in cafés
I want to hear only your light voice running on about Florida
as we pass the changing trafﬁc light and buy grapes for wherever
we will end up praising the mattressless sleigh-bed and the
Mexican egg and the clock that will not make me know
     how to leave you


                                                                   1959

                                to Donald M. Allen

 Now the violets are all gone, the rhinoceroses, the cymbals
 a grisly pale has settled over the stockyard where the fur ﬂies
 and the sound
                  is that of a bulldozer in heat stuck in the mud
 where a lilac still scrawnily blooms and cries out “Walt!”
 so they repair the street in the middle of the night
 and Allen and Peter can once again walk forth to visit friends
 in the illuminated moonlight over the mists and the towers
 having mistakenly thought that Bebe Daniels was in I Cover the Waterfront
 instead of Claudette Colbert it has begun to rain softly and I walk
 slowly thinking of becoming a stalk of asparagus for Hallowe’en
      which idea Vincent poopoos as not being really 40s
 so the weight
                of the rain drifting amiably is like a sentimental breeze
 and seems to have been invented by a collapsed Kim Novak balloon

 yet Janice is helping Kenneth appeal to The Ford Foundation in
 her manner oft described as The Sweet Succinct and Ned is glad
        not to be up too late
                                 for the sake of his music and his ear
              where discipline ﬁnds itself singing and even screaming away

 I shall not dine another night like this with Robin and Don and Joe
 as lightly as the day is gone but that was earlier
                                                           a knock on the door
 my heart your heart

           my head and the strange reality of our ﬂesh in the rain
 so many parts of a strange existence independent but not searching in the night
                          nor in the morning when the rain has stopped


                                                                             1959

           “À la recherche d’ Gertrude Stein”

When I am feeling depressed and anxious sullen
all you have to do is take your clothes off
and all is wiped away revealing life’s tenderness
that we are ﬂesh and breathe and are near us
as you are really as you are I become as I
really am alive and knowing vaguely what is
and what is important to me above the intrusions
of incident and accidental relationships
which have nothing to do with my life

when I am in your presence I feel life is strong
and will defeat all its enemies and all of mine
and all of yours and yours in you and mine in me
sick logic and feeble reasoning are cured
by the perfect symmetry of your arms and legs
spread out making an eternal circle together
creating a golden pillar beside the Atlantic
the faint line of hair dividing your torso
gives my mind rest and emotions their release
into the inﬁnite air where since once we are
together we always will be in this life come what may

      after all the terrible things I do how amazing it is
      to ﬁnd forgiveness and love, not even forgiveness
      since what is done is done and forgiveness isn’t love
      and love is love nothing can ever go wrong
      though things can get irritating boring and dispensable
      (in the imagination) but not really for love
      though a block away you feel distant the mere presence
      changes everything like a chemical dropped on a paper
      and all thoughts disappear in a strange quiet excitement
      I am sure of nothing but this, intensiﬁed by breathing

Shall we win at love or shall we lose
                                           can it be
that hurting and being hurt is a trick forcing the love
we want to appear, that the hurt is a card
and is it black? is it red? is it a paper, dry of tears
chevalier, change your expression! the wind is sweeping over
the gaming tables rufﬂing the cards/they are black and red
like a Futurist torture and how do you know it isn’t always there
waiting while doubt is the father that has you kidnapped by friends

     yet you will always live in a jealous society of accident
you will never know how beautiful you are or how beautiful
the other is, you will continue to refuse to die for yourself
you will continue to sing on trying to cheer everyone up
and they will know as they listen with excessive pleasure that you’re dead
and they will not mind that they have let you entertain
at the expense of the only thing you want in the world/you are amusing
as a game is amusing when someone is forced to lose as in a game I must

                      oh hôtel, you should be merely a bed
surrounded by walls where two souls meet and do nothing but breathe
breathe in breathe out fuse illuminate confuse stick dissemble
but not as cheaters at cards have something to win/you have only to be
as you are being, as you must be, as you always are, as you shall be forever
no matter what fate deals you or the imagination discards like a tyrant
as the drums descend and summon the hatchet over the tinselled realities

you know that I am not here to fool around, that I must win or die
I expect you to do everything because it is of no consequence/no duel
you must rig the deck you must make me win at whatever cost to the reputation
of the establishment/sublime moment of dishonest hope/I must win
for if the ﬂoods of tears arrive they will wash it all away
                                                            and then
you will know what it is to want something, but you may not be allowed
to die as I have died, you may only be allowed to drift downstream
to another body of inimical attractions for which you will substitute/distrust


                                                                               183
 and I will have had my revenge on the black bitch of my nature which you
                              love as I have never loved myself

 but I hold on/I am lyrical to a fault/I do not despair being too foolish
 where will you ﬁnd me, projective verse, since I will be gone?
 for six seconds of your beautiful face I will sell the hotel and commit
 an uninteresting suicide in Louisiana where it will take them a long time
 to know who I am/why I came there/what and why I am and made to happen

On the vast highway
where death streams cheerfully
in the sunlight and the enormous spans
cast their 4 o’clock suspensions
over the harbor I am told
of the inﬁdelities of the Puerto Ricans
and the meanness of the Jews
by an Irish cab driver
it is good that there are so many kinds of us
so death can choose
and even perhaps prefer
he who casts the ﬁrst shadow of the day
on those who are trying to live till dark

      the gentle purr of cab tires in snow
      and hidden stars
                        tears on the windshield
      torn inexorably away in whining motion
      and the dark thoughts which surround neon

      in Union Square I see you for a moment
      red green yellow searchlights cutting through
      falling ﬂakes, head bent to the wind
      wet and frowning, melancholy, trying

      I know perfectly well where you walk to
      and that we’ll meet in even greater darkness
      later and will be warm
                               so our cross

      forward across the square and see
      your surprised grey look become greener
      as I wipe the city’s moisture from
      your face
                 and you shake the snow
      off onto my shoulder, light as a breath
      where the quarrels and vices of
      estranged companions weighed so bitterly
      and accidentally
                          before, I saw you on

      That’s not a cross look it’s a sign of life
      but I’m glad you care how I look at you
      this morning (after I got up) I was thinking
      of President Warren G. Harding and Horace S.
      Warren, father of the little blonde girl
      across the street and another blonde Agnes
      Hedlund (this was in the 6th grade!)        what

      now the day has begun in a soft grey way
      with elephantine trafﬁc trudging along Fifth
      and two packages of Camels in my pocket
      I can’t think of one interesting thing Warren
      G. Harding did, I guess I was passing notes
      to Sally and Agnes at the time he came up
      in our elephantine history course everything

      seems slow suddenly and boring except
      for my insatiable thinking towards you
      as you lie asleep completely plotzed and
      gracious as a hillock in the mist from one
      small window, sunless and only slightly open
      as is your mouth and presently your quiet eyes
      your breathing is like that history lesson

We hardly ever see the moon any more
                                            so no wonder
   it’s so beautiful when we look up suddenly
and there it is gliding broken-faced over the bridges
brilliantly coursing, soft, and a cool wind fans
        your hair over your forehead and your memories
              of Red Grooms’ locomotive landscape
I want some bourbon/you want some oranges/I love the leather
               jacket Norman gave me
                                        and the corduroy coat David
     gave you, it is more mysterious than spring, the El Greco
heavens breaking open and then reassembling like lions
                                         in a vast tragic veldt
     that is far from our small selves and our temporally united
passions in the cathedral of Januaries

    everything is too comprehensible
these are my delicate and caressing poems
I suppose there will be more of those others to come, as in the past
                                      so many!

 I think of you
 and the continents brilliant and arid
 and the slender heart you are sharing my share of with the American air
 as the lungs I have felt sonorously subside slowly greet each morning
 and your brown lashes ﬂutter revealing two perfect dawns colored by New York

 see a vast bridge stretching to the humbled outskirts with only you
             standing on the edge of the purple like an only tree

 and in Toledo the olive groves’ soft blue look at the hills with silver
              like glasses like an old lady’s hair
 it’s well known that God and I don’t get along together
 it’s just a view of the brass works to me, I don’t care about the Moors

 you are smiling, you are emptying the world so we can be alone

                a little travel diary


Wending our way through the gambas, angulas,
the merluzas that taste like the Sea Post on Sunday
and the great quantities of huevos they take off
Spanish Naval ofﬁcers’ uniforms and put on plates,
and reach the gare de Francia in the gloaming
with my ton of books and John’s ton of clothes bought
in a wild ﬁt of enthusiasm in Madrid; all jumbled
together like life is a Jumble Shop

                                      of the theatre
in Spain they said nothing for foreigners
and we head in our lovely 1st class coach, shifting
and sagging, towards the northwest, while in other compartments
Dietrich and Erich von Stroheim share a sandwich of chorizos
and a bottle of Vichy Catalan, in the dining car
the travelling gentleman with linear mustache and many
many rings rolls his cigar around and drinks Martini y
ginebra, and Lillian Gish rolls on over the gorges
with a tear in her left front eye, comme Picasso,
through the night through the night, longitudinous
and affected with stars; the riverbeds so far below look
as a pig’s tongue on a platter, and storms break over
San Sebastian, 40 foot waves drench us pleasantly and we see
a dead dog bloated as a fraise lolling beside the quai
and slowly pulling out to sea

                                to Irún and Biarritz
we go, sapped of anxiety, and there for the ﬁrst time
since arriving in Barcelona I can freely shit
and the surf is so high and the sun is so hot
and it was all built yesterday as everything should be
what a splendid country it is

      of the head of Bill Berkson, aux Deux Magots, (awk!) it gleams

      through the endless tunnels and the silver vistas
      of our quest for the rocher de la Vierge and salt spray

It’s the month of May in my heart as the song
says and everything’s perfect: a little too chilly
for April and the chestnut trees are refusing to bloom
as they should refuse if they don’t want to, sky
clear and blue with a lot of side-paddle steamers
pushing through to Stockholm where the canals’re true-blue

in my spacious quarters on the rue de l’Université
I give a cocktail in the bathroom, everyone gets wet
it’s very beachy; and I clear my head staring at the sign
loi du 29 juillet 1881
                           so capitalizing on a few memories
from childhood by forgetting them, I’m happy as a ﬁnger

the new reality in the city of Balzac! praying to be let
into the cinema and become an inﬂuence, carried through
streets on the shoulders of Messrs Chabrol and Truffaut
towards Nice
                or do you think that the Golden Lion
would taste pleasanter (not with vermouth, lion!)?
no, but San Francisco, maybe, and abalone

is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt
partly because of the ﬂuorescent orange tulips around the birches
partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
as solemn as unpleasantly deﬁnitive as statuary when right in front of it
in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth
between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles

and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint
you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them

at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together the ﬁrst time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
              it seems they were all cheated of some marvellous experience
which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it

I go by to check a slide and I say
that painting’s not so blue

where’s Lana Turner
she’s out eating
and Garbo’s backstage at the Met
everyone’s taking their coat off
so they can show a rib-cage to the rib-watchers
and the park’s full of dancers with their tights and shoes
in little bags
who are often mistaken for worker-outers at the West Side Y
why not
the Pittsburgh Pirates shout because they won
and in a sense we’re all winning
we’re alive

the apartment was vacated by a gay couple
who moved to the country for fun
they moved a day too soon
even the stabbings are helping the population explosion
though in the wrong country
and all those liars have left the U N

      the Seagram Building’s no longer rivalled in interest
      not that we need liquor (we just like it)

      and the little box is out on the sidewalk
      next to the delicatessen
      so the old man can sit on it and drink beer
      and get knocked off it by his wife later in the day
      while the sun is still shining

      oh god it’s wonderful
      to get out of bed
      and drink too much coffee
      and smoke too many cigarettes
      and love you so much

Mothers of America
                          let your kids go to the movies!
get them out of the house so they won’t know what you’re up to
it’s true that fresh air is good for the body
                                                but what about the soul
that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images
and when you grow old as grow old you must
                                                    they won’t hate you
they won’t criticize you they won’t know
                                               they’ll be in some glamorous country
they ﬁrst saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey

they may even be grateful to you
                                   for their ﬁrst sexual experience
which only cost you a quarter
                               and didn’t upset the peaceful home
they will know where candy bars come from
                                                and gratuitous bags of popcorn
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it’s over
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg
near the Williamsburg Bridge
                               oh mothers you will have made the little tykes
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies
they won’t know the difference
                                and if somebody does it’ll be sheer gravy
and they’ll have been truly entertained either way
instead of hanging around the yard
                                     or up in their room
                                                            hating you
prematurely since you won’t have done anything horribly mean yet
except keeping them from the darker joys




                                                                                 197

      so don’t blame me if you won’t take this advice
                                                       and the family breaks up
      and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set

      movies you wouldn’t let them see when they were young

In placing this particular thought
I am taking up the cudgel against indifference
I wish that I might be different but I am
that I am is all I have so what can I do

as the hero of the hour I might have one strange destiny
but it is all mixed up and I have several
I can’t choose between them they are pulling me aloft
which is not to say up like a Baroque ceiling or anything

where is the rain and the lightning to drown or burn us
as there used to be
where are the gods who could abuse and disabuse us often
when am I ever in the country walking along a lane plotting murder

you would think that the best things in life were free
but they’re the worst even the air is dirty
and it’s this “ﬁlth of life” that coats us against pain
so where are we back at the same old stand buying bagels

I think that it would be nice to go away
but that’s reserved for TV and who wants to end up in Paradise
it’s not our milieu
we would be lost as a ﬁsh is lost when it has to swim

and yet and yet
this place is terrible to see and worse to feel
along with the purple you have contracted for an awful virus
and it is Christmas and the children are growing up


                                                               1960

      [the fondest dream of]


        The fondest dream of
        every American boy
        is to go to work and use
        his father’s typewriter

        you spill ink over
        his secretary and follow her
        to the fainting room
        where she fails to wash it off

So the rain falls
it drops all over the place
and where it ﬁnds a little rock pool
it ﬁlls it up with dirt
and the corn grows
a green Bette Davis sits under it
reading a volume of William Morris
oh fertility! beloved of the Western world
you aren’t so popular in China
though they fuck too

and do I really want a son
to carry on my idiocy past the Horned Gates
poor kid                a staggering load

yet it can happen casually
and he lifts a little of the load each day
as I become more and more idiotic
and grows to be a strong strong man
and one day carries as I die
my ﬁnal idiocy and the very gates
into a future of his choice

but what of William Morris
what of you Million Worries
what of Bette Davis in
an evening with william morris
or the world of samuel greenberg

what of Hart Crane
what of phonograph records and gin




                                              201
      what of “what of ”

      you are of me, that’s what
      and that’s the meaning of fertility
      hard and moist and moaning

                            to Patsy Southgate

Voici la clématite around the old door
which I planted, watered, and let die
as I have with so many cats, although sans une claire-voie
and it seemed that the whole summer dipped
when it withered, when the leaves did, and the purple
blossoms lingered as if you could smell them eventually

on ne vit pas par l’essence seule, thank you
Patsy, for the dope on essence de vie and if I’m not
asleep I’ll come tonight to talk about
the old days when my father knocked me into the rose-bed
thereby killing a half dozen of his prized rose plants
yak, yak it’s a wonderful life for the plants

when you think of what Shelley did with such a theme
and long afterwards Mallarmé reciting it to himself
far across the channel in all that loneliness and stren’th
you wonder if I shouldn’t be back on the phone getting black ear
don’t you? well, back to your novel, wench! assez

you and Marisol, the Grace Kelly and Maria Callas
of the New York School, I do wish that clematis had growed
I don’t know what happened, I guess I just lost interest
which along with the current recession ﬁlls me with guilt
and besides I was a kid, as now I can hardly be made responsible
for the money troubles of our nation, almost never
having seen any, but the plant in your life

is the plant that died, “mourir, c’est ainsi pousser”

                       One or another
                       Is lost, since we fall apart
                       Endlessly, in one motion depart
                       From each other.
                                  —d.h. lawrence


            Behind New York there’s a face
            and it’s not Sibelius’s with a cigar
            it was red it was strange and hateful
            and then I became a child again
            like a nadir or a zenith or a nudnik

            what do you think this is my youth
            and the aged future that is sweeping me away
            carless and gasless under the Sutton
            and Beekman Places towards a hellish rage
            it is there that face I fear under ramps

            it is perhaps the period that ends
            the problem as a proposition of days of days
            just an attack on the feelings that stay
            poised in the hurricane’s center that
            eye through which only camels can pass

            but I do not mean that tenderness doesn’t
            linger like a Paris afternoon or a wart
            something dumb and despicable that I love
            because it is silent oh what difference
            does it make me into some kind of space statistic

            a lot is buried under that smile
            a lot of sophistication gone down the drain
            to become the mesh of a mythical ﬁsh
            at which we never stare back never stare back
            where there is so much downright forgery



204
under that I ﬁnd it restful like a bush
some people are outraged by cleanliness
I hate the lack of smells myself and yet I stay
it is better than being actually present
and the stare can swim away into the past

can adorn it with easy convictions rat
cow tiger rabbit dragon snake horse sheep
monkey rooster dog and pig “Flower Drum Song”
so that nothing is vain not the gelded sand
not the old spangled lotus not my ﬂy

which I have thought about but never really
looked at well that’s a certain orderliness
of personality “if you’re brought up Protestant
enough a Catholic” oh shit on the beaches so
what if I did look up your trunks and see it

     ii
then the parallel becomes an eagle parade
of Busby Berkeleyites marching marching half-toe
I suppose it’s the happiest moment in inﬁnity
because we’re dissipated and tired and fond no
I don’t think psychoanalysis shrinks the spleen

here we are and what the hell are we going to do
with it we are going to blow it up like daddy did
only us I really think we should go up for a change
I’m tired of always going down what price glory
it’s one of those timeless priceless words like come

well now how does your conscience feel about that
would you rather explore tomorrow with a sponge
there’s no need to look for a target you’re it
like in childhood when the going was aimed at a
sandwich it all depends on which three of us are there

      but here come the prophets with their loosening nails
      it is only as blue as the lighting under the piles
      I have something portentous to say to you but which
      of the papier-mâché languages do you understand you
      don’t dare to take it off paper much less put it on

      yes it is strange that everyone fucks and every
      one mentions it and it’s boring too that faded ﬂoor
      how many teeth have chewed a little piece of the lover’s
      ﬂesh how many teeth are there in the world it’s like
      Harpo Marx smiling at a million pianos call that Africa

      call it New Guinea call it Poughkeepsie I guess
      it’s love I guess the season of renunciation is at “hand”
      the ﬁnal fatal hour of turpitude and logic demise
      is when you miss getting rid of something delouse
      is when you don’t louse something up which way is the inn

            iii
      I’m looking for a million-dollar heart in a carton
      of frozen strawberries like the Swedes where is sunny England
      and those ﬁelds where they stillbirth the wars why
      did they suddenly stop playing why is Venice a Summer
      Festival and not New York were you born in America

      the inscrutable passage of a lawn mower punctuates
      the newly installed Muzak in the Shubert Theatre am I nuts
      or is this the happiest moment of my life who’s arguing it’s
      I mean ’tis lawd sakes it took daddy a long time to have
      that accident so Ant Grace could get completely into black

      didn’t you know we was all going to be Zen Buddhists after
      what we did you sure don’t know much about war-guilt
      or nothin and the peach trees continued to rejoice around
      the prick which was for once authorized by our Congress
      though inactive what if it had turned out to be a volcano

that’s a mulatto of another nationality of marble
it’s time for dessert I don’t care what street this is
you’re not telling me to take a tour are you
I don’t want to look at any ﬁngernails or any toes
I just want to go on being subtle and dead like life

I’m not naturally so detached but I think
they might send me up any minute so I try to be free
you know we’ve all sinned a lot against science
so we really ought to be available as an apple on a bough
pleasant thought fresh air free love cross-pollenization

oh oh god how I’d love to dream let alone sleep it’s night
the soft air wraps me like a swarm it’s raining and I have
a cold I am a real human being with real ascendancies
and a certain amount of rapture what do you do with a kid
like me if you don’t eat me I’ll have to eat myself

it’s a strange curse my “generation” has we’re all
like the ﬂowers in the Agassiz Museum perpetually ardent
don’t touch me because when I tremble it makes a noise
like a Chinese wind-bell it’s that I’m seismographic is all
and when a Jesuit has stared you down for ever after you clink

I wonder if I’ve really scrutinized this experience like
you’re supposed to have if you can type there’s not much
soup left on my sleeve energy creativity guts ponderableness
lent is coming in imponderableness “I’d like to die smiling” ugh
and a very small tiptoe is crossing the threshold away

whither Lumumba whither oh whither Gauguin
I have often tried to say goodbye to strange fantoms I
read about in the newspapers and have always succeeded
though the ones at “home” are dependent on Dependable
Laboratory and Sales Company on Pulaski Street strange



                                                                   207
      I think it’s goodbye to a lot of things like Christmas
      and the Mediterranean and halos and meteorites and villages
      full of damned children well it’s goodbye then as in Strauss
      or some other desperately theatrical venture it’s goodbye
      to lunch to love to evil things and to the ultimate good as “well”

      the strange career of a personality begins at ﬁve and ends
      forty minutes later in a fog the rest is just a lot of stranded
      ships honking their horns full of joy-seeking cadets in bloomers
      and beards it’s okay with me but must they cheer while they honk
      it seems that breath could easily ﬁll a balloon and drift away

      scaring the locusts in the straggling grey of living dumb
      exertions then the useful noise would come of doom of data
      turned to elegant decoration like a strangling prince once ordered
      no there is no precedent of history no history nobody came before
      nobody will ever come before and nobody ever was that man

      you will not die not knowing this is true this year


                                                                      1961

              essay on style


Someone else’s Leica sitting on the table
the black kitchen table I am painting
the ﬂoor yellow, Bill is painting it
wouldn’t you know my mother would call
up
     and complain?
                      my sister’s pregnant and
went to the country for the weekend without
telling her
            in point of fact why don’t I
go out to have dinner with her or “let her”
come in? well if Mayor Wagner won’t allow private
cars on Manhattan because of the snow, I
will probably never see her again
                                     considering
my growingly more perpetual state and how
can one say that angel in the Frick’s wings
are “attached” if it’s a real angel? now

I was reﬂecting the other night meaning
I was being reﬂected upon that Sheridan Square
is remarkably beautiful, sitting in jack
delaney’s looking out the big race-track window
on the wet
              drinking a cognac while Edwin
read my new poem it occurred to me how impossible
it is to fool Edwin not that I don’t know as
much as the next about obscurity in modern verse
but he
          always knows what it’s about as well
as what it is do you think we can ever
strike as and but, too, out of the language
then we can attack well since it has no
application whatsoever neither as a state
of being or a rest for the mind no such
things available
                   where do you think I’ve

      decorating
                   a Christmas tree disgusts me that’s
      where
              that’s one of the places yetbutaswell
      I’m glad I went to that party for Ed Dorn
      last night though he didn’t show up do you think
      ,Bill, we can get rid of though also, and also?
      maybe your
                     lettrism is the only answer treating
      the typewriter as an intimate organ why not?
      nothing else is (intimate)
                                   no I am not going
      to have you “in” for dinner nor am I going “out”
      I am going to eat alone for the rest of my life

vincent and i inaugurate a movie theatre


 Now that the Charles Theatre has opened
 it looks like we’re going to have some wonderful times
 Allen and Peter, why are you going away
 our country’s black and white past spread out
 before us is no time to spread over India
 like last night in the busy balcony I see
 your smoky images before the smoky screen
 everyone smoking, Bogart, Bacall and her advanced sister
 and Hepburn too tense to smoke but MacMurray rich enough
 relaxed and ugly, poor Alice Adams so in-pushed and out
 in the clear exposition of AP American or Associated
 Paranoia and Allen and I getting depressed and angry
 becoming again the male version of wallﬂower or wallpaper
 or something while Vincent points out that when anything
 good happens the movie has just ﬂicked over to fantasy
 only fantasy in all America can be good
 because all Alice Adams wanted was a nose
 just as long as any other girl’s and a dress
 just as rustly and a mind just as empty so America
 could ﬁll it with checks and ﬂags and invitations
 and the old black cooks falling down the cellar stairs
 for generations to show how phony it all is
 but the whites didn’t pay attention that’s slaving away
 at something, maybe the dance would have been fun
 if anyone’d given one but it would have been over
 before Alice enjoyed it and what’s the difference
 no wonder you want to ﬁnd out about India take
 a print of Alice Adams with you it will cheer them up

      It’s eight in the morning
      everyone has left
      the New York Times had put itself to bed on Wednesday
      or Thursday and arrived
      this morning I feel pale
      and read the difference between the Masai and the Kikuyu
      one keeps and identiﬁes
      the other keeps and learns
      “newfangledness” in Wyatt’s time was not a virtue was it
      or should I get up
      go out into the Polish sunlight
      and riot in Washington Square with Joan with the “folk”
      if you like singing
      what happened to the clavichord

      with hot dogs peanuts and pigeons where’s the clavichord
      though it’s raining
      I’m not afraid for the string
      they have their hats on across the street in the dirty window
      leaning on elbows
      without any pillows
      how sad the lower East side is on Sunday morning in May
      eating yellow eggs
      eating St. Bridget’s benediction
      washing the world down with rye and Coca-Cola and the news
      Joe stumbles home
      pots and pans crash to the ﬂoor
      everyone’s happy again

                                       face the frigidaire
          it’s April
          no May
          it’s May

such little things have to be established in morning
after the big things of night
                                do you want me to come? when
I think of all the things I’ve been thinking of I feel insane
simply “life in Birmingham is hell’’
                                        simply “you will miss me
                                             but that’s good”
when the tears of a whole generation are assembled
they will only ﬁll a coffee cup
                                  just because they evaporate
doesn’t mean life has heat
                               “this various dream of living”
I am alive with you
                    full of anxious pleasures and pleasurable anxiety
hardness and softness
                 listening while you talk and talking while you read
I read what you read
                    you do not read what I read
which is right, I am the one with the curiosity
you read for some mysterious reason
                           I read simply because I am a writer
the sun doesn’t necessarily set, sometimes it just disappears
when you’re not here someone walks in and says
                                                       “hey,




                                                                        213

                               those black and white teeth!
  you never come when you say you’ll come but on the other hand you do come

I’m getting tired of not wearing underwear
and then again I like it
                            strolling along
feeling the wind blow softly on my genitals
though I also like them encased in something
ﬁrm, almost tight, like a projectile
                                         at
a streetcorner I stop and a lamppost is
bending over the trafﬁc pensively like a
praying mantis, not lighting anything,
just looking
              who dropped that empty carton
of cracker jacks I wonder I ﬁnd the favor
that’s a good sign
                    it’s the blue everyone
is talking about an enormous cloud which hides
the observatory blimp                    when you
ride on a 5th Avenue bus you hide on a 5th
Avenue bus I mean compared to you walking
don’t hide                 there you are trying
to hide behind a ﬁre hydrant                        I’m
not going to the Colisseum I’m going to
the Russian Tea Room fooled you didn’t I
well                     it is nicer in the Park
with the pond and all that                          okay
lake                     and bicyclists give you
a feeling of being at leisure in the open
air lazy and good-tempered             which is
fairly unusual these days                   I liked
for instance             carrying my old Gautier book
and L’Ombra over to LeRoi’s the other
pale afternoon through the crowds of 3rd
Avenue and the ambulance and the drunk

                      poem en forme de saw


 I ducked out of sight behind the sawmill
 nobody saw me because of the falls the gates the sluice the tourist boats
 the children were trailing their ﬁngers in the water
 and the swans, regal and smarty, were nipping their “little” ﬁngers
 I heard one swan remark “That was a good nip
 though they are not as interesting as sausages” and another
 reply “Nor as tasty as those peasants we got away from the elephant that time”
 but I didn’t really care for conversation that day
 I wanted to be alone
 which is why I went to the mill in the ﬁrst place
 now I am alone and hate it
 I don’t want to just make boards for the rest of my life
 I’m distressed
 the water is very beautiful but you can’t go into it
 because of the gunk
 and the dog is always rolling over, I like dogs on their “little” feet
 I think I may scamper off to Winnipeg to see Raymond
 but what’ll happen to the mill
 I see the cobwebs collecting already
 and later those other webs, those awful predatory webs
 if I stay right here I will eventually get into the newspapers
 like Robert Frost
 willow trees, willow trees they remind me of Desdemona
 I’m so damned literary
 and at the same time the waters rushing past remind me of nothing
 I’m so damned empty
 what is all this vessel shit anyway
 we are all rushing down the River Happy Times
 ducking poling bumping sinking and swimming
 and we arrive at the beach
 the chaff is sand
 alone as a tree bumping another tree in a storm
 that’s not really being alone, is it, signed The Saw


                                                                          1961

     metaphysical poem


When do you want to go
I’m not sure I want to go there
where do you want to go
any place
I think I’d fall apart any place else
well I’ll go if you really want to
I don’t particularly care
but you’ll fall apart any place else
I can just go home
I don’t really mind going there
but I don’t want to force you to go there
you won’t be forcing me I’d just as soon
I wouldn’t be able to stay long anyway
maybe we could go somewhere nearer
I’m not wearing a jacket
just like you weren’t wearing a tie
well I didn’t say we had to go
I don’t care whether you’re wearing one
we don’t really have to do anything
well all right let’s not
okay I’ll call you
yes call me

jour de fête j’ai composé mon “Gloriﬁcation” hommage au poète américain
                         lyrique et profond, Wallace Stevens

                                               quels délices
                   I would like to tell you what I think about bankers but . . .
                                     except W. C. Fields
what do you want from a bank but love           ouch
                  but I don’t get any love from Wallace Stevens no I don’t
I think délices is a lot of horseshit and that comes from one who inﬁnitely

                                               and the bank rolled on
                                               and Stevens strolled on
                                               an ordinary evening alone
                                               with a lot of people

                     here with my red blue green and natch pencils and the erasers
                     with the mirror behind me and the desk in front of me
                     like an anti-Cocteau movement
     “who did you have lunch with?” “you” “oops!” how are you

                 then too, the other day I was walking through a train
                 with my suitcase and I overheard someone say “speaking of faggots”
                 now isn’t life difﬁcult enough without that
                 and why am I always carrying something

down at the box-ofﬁce of Town Hall I was thinking of you in your no hat
   music often reminds me of nothing, that way, like reforming

September 15 (supine, unshaven, hungover, passive, softspoken) I was
very happy
               on Altair 4, I love you that way, it was on Altair 4 “a happy day”
               I knew it would be
               yes to everything
                                     I think you will ﬁnd the pot in the corner
               where the Krells left it
                                           rub it a little and music comes out
               the music of the fears
                                          I reformed we reformed each other
               being available
                                 it is something our friends don’t understand
               if you loosen your tie
                                          my heart will leap out
               like a Tanagra sculpture
                                             from the crater of the Corsican “lip”
               and ﬂying through the heavens
                                                     I am reminded of Kit Carson
               and all those smiles which were exactly like yours
               but we hadn’t met yet
                                          when are you going away on “our” trip


                                                                               225

                                        if I make you angry you are no longer doubtful
                if I make you happy you are no longer doubtful
                                                               what’s wrong with doubt


it is mostly that your face
is like the sky behind the Sherry Netherland
blue instead of air, touching instead of remote, warm instead of racing
you are as intimate as a “cup” of vodka
                         and when yesterday arrives and troubles us you always say no
                         I don’t believe you at ﬁrst but you say no no no no
                         and pretty soon I am smiling and doing just what I want
                         again
                                     that’s very important
                                     you put the shit back in the drain
                                     and then you actually ﬁnd the stopper

take back September 15 to Aug something
I think you are wonderful on your birthday
                                             I think you are wonderful
     on all your substitute birthdays
                                      I am rather irritated at your being born
                                                  at all
                                        where did you put that stopper
                           you are the biggest fool I ever laid eyes on
                           that’s what they thought about the Magi, I believe


ﬁrst you peel the potatoes

in the pit under the dark there were books
being written about strange rites of the time
the time was called The Past and the books were in German
which scholars took to be Sanskrit or Urdu
(much laughter) which later turned out to be indeed
Sanskrit or Urdu (end of laughter, start of ﬁght)
and at the same time the dark was going on and on
never getting bluer or greener or purpler just
going on and that was civilization and still is
nobody could see the ﬁght but they could hear what
it was about and that’s the way things were and stayed
and are except that in time the sounds started to
sound different (familiarity) and that was English

       the sky is more blue and it is getting cold
       last night I saw Garﬁnkel’s Surgical Supply truck
       and knew I was near “home” though dazed and thoughtful
                   what did you do to make me think
                   after we led the bum to the hospital
                   and you got into the cab
                   I was feeling lost myself


                        (always)

never to lose those moments in the Carlyle without a tie

endless as a stick-pin barely visible you
drown whatever one thought of as perception and
let all the clouds in under the yellow heaters
meeting                             somewhere over St. Louis
call me earlier because I might want to do something else
except eat                    ugh

endlessly unraveling itself before the Christopher Columbus Tavern
quite a series was born                          as where I am going is to
Quo Vadis for lunch
out there in the blabbing wind and glass         c’est l’azur

there is a light there that neither
of us will obscure

      Lana Turner has collapsed!
      I was trotting along and suddenly
      it started raining and snowing
      and you said it was hailing
      but hailing hits you on the head
      hard so it was really snowing and
      raining and I was in such a hurry
      to meet you but the trafﬁc
      was acting exactly like the sky
      and suddenly I see a headline
      lana turner has collapsed!
      there is no snow in Hollywood
      there is no rain in California
      I have been to lots of parties
      and acted perfectly disgraceful
      but I never actually collapsed
      oh Lana Turner we love you get up

From behind he takes her waist
and lifts her, her lavender waist
stained with tears and her mascara
is running, her neck is tired
from drooping. She ﬂoats she steps
automatically correct, then suddenly
she is alive up there and smiles.
How much greater triumph for him
that she had so despaired when his
hands encircled her like a pillar
and lifted her into the air
which after him will turn to rock­
like boredom, but not till after
many hims and he will not be there.

The punch bowl was near the cloakroom
so the pints could be taken out of the
boys’ cloaks and dumped into the punch.
Outside the branches beat hysterically
towards the chandeliers, just fended
off by fearful windows. The chandeliers
giggle a little. There were many
introductions but few invitations. I
found a spot of paint on my coat as
others found pimples. It is easy to
dance it is even easy to dance together
sometimes. We were very young and ugly
we knew it, everybody knew it.

             answer to voznesensky & evtushenko


      We are tired of your tiresome imitations of Mayakovsky
      we are tired
                    of your dreary tourist ideas of our Negro selves
      our selves are in far worse condition than the obviousness
      of your color sense
                            your general sense of Poughkeepsie is
      a gaucherie no American poet would be guilty of in Tiﬂis
      thanks to French Impressionism
                                         we do not pretend to know more
      than can be known
                             how many sheets have you stained with your semen
      oh Tartars, and how many
                                   of our loves have you illuminated with
      your heart your breath
                               as we poets of America have loved you
      your countrymen, our countrymen, our lives, your lives, and
      the dreary expanses of your translations
                                                  your idiotic manifestos
      and the strange black cock which has become ours despite your envy

      we do what we feel
                            you do not even do what you must or can
      I do not love you any more since Mayakovsky died and Pasternak
      theirs was the death of my nostalgia for your tired ignorant race
      since you insist on race
                                you shall not take my friends away from me
      because they live in Harlem
                                     you shall not make Mississippi into Sakhalin
      you came too late, a lovely talent doesn’t make a ball
            I consider myself to be black and you not even part
      where you see death
                             you see a dance of death
                                                        which is
      imperialist, implies training, requires techniques
      our ballet does not employ
                                    you are indeed as cold as wax
      as your progenitor was red, and how greatly we loved his redness

236
in the fullness of our own idiotic sun! what
“roaring universe” outshouts his violent triumphant sun!

     Mayakovsky’s hat worn by a horse

          Just when I was getting completely through
          dried out, balled up, anxious and empty
          like a gulch in a John Huston movie
          I went to see Strange Interlude and began
          to go away for a weekend on the beach
          into that theatre again and again
          now I have a pot of basil a friend gave
          me and am reading Keats again and realize
          that everything is impossible in a different way
          well so what, but there’s a difference
          between a window and a wall again

                        fantasy
          (dedicated to the health of Allen Ginsberg)

How do you like the music of Adolph
                                           Deutsch? I like
it, I like it better than Max Steiner’s. Take his
score for Northern Pursuit, the Helmut Dantine theme
was . . .
            and then the window fell on my hand. Errol
Flynn was skiing by. Down
                              down down went the grim
grey submarine under the “cold” ice.
                                          Helmut was
safely ashore, on the ice.
                             What dreams, what incredible
fantasies of snow farts will this all lead to?
                                               I
don’t know, I have stopped thinking like a sled dog.

The main thing is to tell a story.
                                     It is almost
very important. Imagine
                            throwing away the avalanche
so early in the movie. I am the only spy left
in Canada,
              but just because I’m alone in the snow
doesn’t necessarily mean I’m a Nazi.
                                         Let’s see,
two aspirins a vitamin C tablet and some baking soda
should do the trick, that’s practically an
                                           Alka
Seltzer. Allen come out of the bathroom
                                            and take it.
I think someone put butter on my skis instead
of wax.
          Ouch. The leanto is falling over in the
ﬁrs, and there is another fatter spy here. They
didn’t tell me they sent
                          him. Well, that takes care


                                                             243
      of him, boy were those huskies hungry.
                                                   Allen,
      are you feeling any better? Yes, I’m crazy about
      Helmut Dantine
                           but I’m glad that Canada will remain
      free. Just free, that’s all, never argue with the movies.

How could I be so foolish as to not believe
that my great orange cat Boris (Armed with Madness)
Butts loves me when he runs to the door like a dog
each night when I come home from work and
probably isn’t even particularly hungry
                                        or lays
his conspicuous hairs on my darkest clothes
out of pure longing for my smell which they do have
because he looks like my best friend my constant lover
hopelessly loyal tawny and apt and whom I hopelessly love

      Now your protesting demons summon themselves
           with ﬁre against the Castilian dark
      and solitary light
                         your mother dead on the hearth
      and your heart at rest on the border of constellary futures

      no domesticated cemeteries can enshroud your ﬂight
            of linear solarities and quiescent tumbrils
      vision of the carrion
                              past made glassy and golden
      to reveal the dark, the dark in all its ancestral clarity

      where our futures lie increasingly in ﬁre
         twisted ropes of sound encrusting our brains
      your water air and earth
                                insist on our joining you
      in recognition of colder prides and less negotiable ambitions

      we shall continue to correct all classical revisions
            of ourselves as trials of ceremonial worth
      and purple excess
                          improving your soul’s expansion
      in the night and developing our own in salt-like praise
