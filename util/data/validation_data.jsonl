Employ vivid imagery and a lyrical, introspective tone to explore themes of desire, societal judgment, and the internal conflicts of being true to oneself. Invoke the urban landscape as a backdrop, with metaphors that contrast bustling city life against moments of personal introspection. Capture the essence of yearning and the struggle for acceptance, reflecting on the symbolic journey of self-discovery and the quest for belonging in a world of contradictions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: Homosexuality\nContent:\nSo we are taking off our masks, are we, and keeping\nour mouths shut? as if we’d been pierced by a glance!\n\nThe song of an old cow is not more full of judgment\nthan the vapors which escape one’s soul when one is sick;\n\nso I pull the shadows around me like a puff\nand crinkle my eyes as if at the most exquisite moment\n\nof a very long opera, and then we are off !\nwithout reproach and without hope that our delicate feet\n\nwill touch the earth again, let alone “very soon.”\nIt is the law of my own voice I shall investigate.\n\nI start like ice, my ﬁnger to my ear, my ear\nto my heart, that proud cur at the garbage can\n\nin the rain.
